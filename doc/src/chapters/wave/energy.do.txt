===== Problem: energy balance in the wave equation =====

The wave equation implies a certain energy balance in the domain $\Omega$,
which is a property that is of physical interest in itself and that can
also be used for program verification.

The standard, linear wave equation in 1D reads

!bt
\[
u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx},\quad x\in (0,L),\ t\in (0,T]
\tp 
\]
!et
As initial conditions we choose the general expressions

!bt
\[ u(x,0) = I(x),\quad u_t(x,0)=V(x)\tp \]
!et
The boundary conditions are first taken as $u_x=0$ for $x=0$ and $x=L$.

We multiply the wave equation by $u_t$,
integrate over the domain $\Omega=[0,L]$,

!bt
\[ \int_0^L u_{tt}u_t dx = \int_0^L u_{xx}u_tdx\tp\]
!et
Applying integration by parts,

!bt
\begin{align*}
\end
integrate the $u_tu_u{xx}$ term by parts, and show that

!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(K+P) = 0,
\end{equation}
!et
where

!bt
\begin{equation}
K = \half\int_0^L u_t^2\dx,\quad P = \half\int_0^L (cu_x)^2\dx
\tp 
\end{equation}
!et

__Remark.__
It is common to denote $K$ as the kinetic energy and $P$ as the
potential energy. This is sometimes not completely physically correct.
For example, when $u$ is the displacement of a string, we have the
equation $\varrho u_{tt} = Tu_{xx}$, where $\varrho$ is the mass per
length unit of the string ("density"), and $T$ is the tension in the
string. The velocity of the string is $u_t$ and the kinetic energy is
hence $\half\varrho\int_0^L u_t^2\dx$ (recall the standard
formula $\half mv^2$ for the kinetic energy of a particle, a
little piece of the string with mass $\varrho\dx$ therefore has
kinetic energy $\half\varrho\dx u_t^2$, which we then integrate
over the domain).  The worked done by the tension force is stored as
elastic energy and equals $\half Tu_x^2$. If we divide the
equation by $\varrho$ and set $c^2 = T/\varrho$, we see that the
quantities $K$ and $P$ as defined above are proportional to the
kinetic and potential energy expressions of a string, but not exactly
equal.
