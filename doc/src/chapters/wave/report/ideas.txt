Conclusion: program radiation conditions in different ways, see
what it gives, either a report on that or on the effect of
boundary conditions in general (Dirichlet, Neumann, periodic, radiation:
 - Neumann left, Dirichlet right
 - periodic
 - Neumann left, radiation right
 - init cond: gauss or plug in the middle
What about plug with small C - do the ripples radiate correctly out of the domain?
BCs in general have the widest appeal here!

Or just periodic boundary conditions?

First Mathematical model with IBVP in a box and nomenclature in a
table. Then Numerical method with scheme, BCs, and html png movie
of stencil (perhaps appendix). Key properties of the scheme,
stability and trunc error and C=1 property, in a summary admon.

* Waves in discontinuous media - report pulse1D solutions

* On the appoximation of radiation conditions
(centered w/elimination, ghost values, first-order upwind explicit
at end point, damped layer) - gauss and plug, see what the remaining
wave motion in [0,L] is

* Effect of boundary conditions
(simple, incl periodic,
nice extra code blocks for radiation, can add absorbing layer,
can experiment with wrong c in radiation cond., can have difference
operators definitions in a table)

* Waves over a hump (?) - can be blood flow or tsunamis

* On the similarities of blood flow and tsunamis in the world of mathematics
(can derive the models, nice pysketches, present schemes, simulate
gaussian hill vs box)

* footnotes
* question admon with !bquiz
* notice and warning admons
