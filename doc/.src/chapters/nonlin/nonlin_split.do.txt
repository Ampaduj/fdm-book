======= Operator splitting methods =======
label{nonlin:splitting}

Operator splitting is a natural and old idea. When a PDE or system of PDEs
contains different terms expressing different physics, it is natural to
use different numerical methods for different physical processes. This can
optimize and simplify the overall solution process. The idea was
especially popularized in the context of the Navier-Stokes equations
and reaction-diffusion PDEs. Common names for the technique are *operator
splitting*, *fractional step* methods, and *split-step* methods. We shall
stick to the former name.
In the context of nonlinear differential equations, operator splitting
can be used to isolate nonlinear terms and simplify the solution methods.

A related technique, often known as dimensional splitting or
alternating direction implicit (ADI) methods, is to split the spatial
dimensions and solve a 2D or 3D problem as two or three
consecutive 1D problems, but this type of splitting
is not to be further considered here.

===== Ordinary operator splitting for ODEs =====
label{nonlin:splitting:ODE}

idx{operator splitting} idx{splitting ODEs}
idx{fractional step methods}

Consider first an ODE where the right-hand side is split into two
terms:

!bt
\begin{equation}
u' = f_0(u) + f_1(u)\tp
\end{equation}
!et
In case $f_0$ and $f_1$ are linear functions of $u$, $f_0=au$ and $f_1=bu$,
we have $u(t)=Ie^{(a+b)t}$, if $u(0)=I$.
When going one time step of length $\Delta t$ from $t_n$ to $t_{n+1}$, we have

!bt
\[ u(t_{n+1}) = u(t_n)e^{(a+b)\Delta t}\tp\]
!et
This expression can be also be written as

!bt
\[ u(t_{n+1}) = u(t_n)e^{a\Delta t}e^{b\Delta t},\]
!et
or

!bt
\begin{align}
u^\stepzero &= u(t_n)e^{a\Delta t},
label{nonlin:splitting:ODE:step1}\\
u(t_{n+1}) &= u^\stepzero e^{b\Delta t}
label{nonlin:splitting:ODE:step2}
\end{align}
!et
The first step (ref{nonlin:splitting:ODE:step1}) means solving
$u'=f_0$ over a time interval $\Delta t$ with $u(t_n)$ as start value.
The second step (ref{nonlin:splitting:ODE:step2}) means solving
$u'=f_1$ over a time interval $\Delta t$ with the value at the end
of the first step as start value.
That is, we progress the solution in two steps and solve
two ODEs $u'=f_0$ and $u'=f_1$. The order of the equations is not
important. From the derivation above we see that solving $u'=f_1$
prior to $u'=f_0$ can equally well be done.

The technique is exact if the ODEs are linear. For nonlinear ODEs it is
only an approximate method with error $\Delta t$. The technique can
be extended to an arbitrary number of steps; i.e., we may split the PDE
system into any number of subsystems. Examples will illuminate this principle.


===== Strang splitting for ODEs =====
label{nonlin:splitting:ODE_Strang}

idx{Strang splitting}

The accuracy of the splitting method in Section ref{nonlin:splitting:ODE}
can be improved from $\Oof{\Delta t}$ to $\Oof{\Delta t^2}$ using so-called
*Strang splitting*, where we take half a step with the $f_0$ operator,
a full step with the $f_1$ operator, and finally half another step with
the $f_0$ operator. During a time interval $\Delta t$ the algorithm can
be written as follows.

!bt
\begin{align*}
\frac{du^{\stepzero}}{dt} &= f_0(u^{\stepzero}),
\quad u^{\stepzero}(t_n)=u(t_n),
\quad t\in [t_n,t_n+\half\Delta t],\\
\frac{du^{\stephalf}}{dt} &= f_1(u^{\stephalf}),
\quad u^{\stephalf}(t_n)=u^{\stepzero}(t_{n+\half}),
\quad t\in [t_n,t_n+\Delta t],\\
\frac{du^{\stepone}}{dt}  &= f_0(u^{\stepone}),
\quad u^{\stepone}(t_n+\half)=u^{\stephalf}(t_{n+\half}),
\quad t\in [t_n+\half\Delta t, t_n+\Delta t]\tp
\end{align*}
!et
The global solution is set as $u(t_{n+1}) = u^{\stepone}(t_{n+1})$.

There is no use in combining higher-order methods with
ordinary splitting since the error due to splitting is $\Oof{\Delta
t}$, but for Strang splitting it makes sense to use schemes of order
$\Oof{\Delta t^2}$.

With the notation introduced for Strang splitting, we may express
ordinary first-order splitting as

!bt
\begin{align*}
\frac{du^{\stepzero}}{dt} &= f_0(u^{\stepzero}),\quad u^{\stepzero}(t_n)=u(t_n),
\quad t\in [t_n,t_n+\Delta t],\\
\frac{du^{\stepone}}{dt} &= f_1(u^{\stepone}),\quad u^{\stepone}(t_n)=u^{\stepzero}(t_{n+1}),
\quad t\in [t_n,t_n+\Delta t],
\end{align*}
!et
with global solution set as $u(t_{n+1}) = u^{\stepone}(t_{n+1})$.

===== Example: Logistic growth =====
label{nonlin:splitting:logistic}

Let us split the (scaled) logistic equation

!bt
\[ u'=u(1-u),\quad u(0)=0.1,\]
!et
with solution $u=(9e^{-t}+1)^{-1}$, into

!bt
\[ u'=u - u^2 = f_0(u) + f_1(u), \quad f_0(u)=u,\quad f_1(u)=-u^2\tp\]
!et
We solve $u'=f_0(u)$ and $u'=f_1(u)$ by a Forward Euler step.
In addition, we add a method where we solve $u'=f_0(u)$ analytically,
since the equation is actually $u'=u$ with solution $e^t$.
The software that accompanies the following methods is the file
"`split_logistic.py`": "${src_nonlin}/split_logistic.py".

=== Splitting techniques ===

Ordinary splitting takes a Forward Euler step for each of the ODEs
according to

!bt
\begin{align}
\frac{u^{\stepzero,n+1} - u^{\stepzero,n}}{\Delta t} &=
f_0(u^{\stepzero,n}),\quad
u^{\stepzero,n} = u(t_n),\quad t\in [t_n,t_n+\Delta t],\\
\frac{u^{\stepone,n+1} - u^{\stepone, n}}{\Delta t} &= f_1(u^{\stepone,n}),\quad
u^{\stepone,n} = u^{\stepzero,n+1},\quad t\in [t_n,t_n+\Delta t],
\end{align}
!et
with $u(t_{n+1}) = u^{\stepone,n+1}$.

Strang splitting takes the form

!bt
\begin{align}
\frac{u^{\stepzero,n+\half} - u^{\stepzero,n}}{\half\Delta t} &=
f_0(u^{\stepzero,n}),\quad
u^{\stepzero,n} = u(t_n),\quad t\in [t_n,t_n+\half\Delta t],\\
\frac{u^{\stephalf,n+1}-u^{\stephalf,n}}{\Delta t} &=
f_1(u^{\stephalf,n}),\quad
u^{\stephalf,n} = u^{\stepzero, n+\half},\quad t\in [t_n,t_n+\Delta t],\\
\frac{u^{\stepone, n+1} - u^{\stepone, n+\half}}{\half\Delta t} &=
f_0(u^{\stepone,n+\half}),\quad
u^{\stepone,n+\half} = u^{\stephalf,n+1},\quad
t\in [t_n+\half\Delta t, t_n+\Delta t]\tp
\end{align}
!et

=== Verbose implementation ===

The following function computes four solutions arising from the Forward
Euler method, ordinary splitting, Strang splitting, as well as Strang splitting
with exact treatment of $u'=f_0(u)$:

@@@CODE src-nonlin/split_logistic.py fromto: import numpy@def solver_compact

=== Compact implementation ===

We have used quite many lines for the steps in the splitting methods.
Many will prefer to condense the code a bit, as done here:

@@@CODE-8 src-nonlin/split_logistic.py fromto: # Ordinary splitting@return u_FE

=== Results ===

Figure ref{nonlin:splitting:ODE:logistic:fig} shows that the impact of
splitting is significant. Interestingly, however,
the Forward Euler method applied to the entire problem directly is much more
accurate than any of the splitting schemes. We also see that Strang
splitting is definitely more accurate than ordinary splitting and that
it helps a bit to use an exact solution of $u'=f_0(u)$.  With a large
time step ($\Delta t = 0.2$, left plot in Figure
ref{nonlin:splitting:ODE:logistic:fig}), the asymptotic values are off
by 20-30%.  A more reasonable time step ($\Delta t = 0.05$, right plot
in Figure ref{nonlin:splitting:ODE:logistic:fig}) gives better
results, but still the asymptotic values are up to 10% wrong.

As technique for solving nonlinear ODEs, we realize that the present
case study is not particularly promising, as the Forward Euler method
both linearizes the original problem and provides a solution that is
much more accurate than any of the splitting techniques.
In complicated multi-physics settings, on the other hand, splitting
may be the only feasible way to go, and sometimes you really need to apply
different numerics to different parts of a PDE problem.
But in very simple problems, like the logistic ODE, splitting is just an
inferior technique. Still, the logistic ODE is ideal for introducing all
the mathematical details and for investigating the behavior.

===== Reaction-diffusion equation =====
label{nonlin:splitting:RD}

Consider a diffusion equation coupled to chemical reactions modeled by
a nonlinear term $f(u)$:

!bt
\[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \dfc\nabla^2u + f(u)\tp\]
!et
This is a physical process composed of two individual processes:
$u$ is the concentration of a substance that is locally generated by
a chemical reaction $f(u)$, while $u$ is spreading in space because
of diffusion. There are obviously two time scales: one for the chemical
reaction and one for diffusion. Typically, fast chemical reactions require
much finer time stepping than slower diffusion processes.
It could therefore be advantageous to split
the two physical effects in separate models and use different numerical methods
for the two.

A natural spitting in the present case is

!bt
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial u^{\stepzero}}{\partial t} &= \dfc\nabla^2 u^{\stepzero},
label{nonlin:splitting:RD:eq:diffu}\\
\frac{\partial u^{\stepone}}{\partial t} &= f(u^{\stepone})
label{nonlin:splitting:RD:eq:decay}\tp
\end{align}
!et
Looking at these familiar problems,
we may apply a $\theta$ rule (implicit) scheme for
(ref{nonlin:splitting:RD:eq:diffu}) and avoid dealing with nonlinearities
by applying an explicit scheme for (ref{nonlin:splitting:RD:eq:decay}).

Suppose we have some solution $u$ at time level $t_n$. For flexibility,
we define a $\theta$ method for the diffusion part
(ref{nonlin:splitting:RD:eq:diffu}) by

!bt
\[ [D_t u^\stepzero =
\dfc (D_xD_x u^\stepzero + D_y D_y u^\stepzero)]^{n+\theta}\tp\]
!et
We use $u$ as initial condition for $u^\stepzero$.

The reaction part, which is defined at each mesh point (without coupling
values in different mesh points), can employ any scheme for an ODE.
Here we use an Adams-Bashforth method of order 2. Recall that the overall
accuracy of the splitting method
is maximum $\Oof{\Delta t^2}$ for Strang splitting,
otherwise it is just $\Oof{\Delta t}$. Higher-order methods for ODEs will
therefore be a waste of work. The 2nd-order Adams-Bashforth method reads

!bt
\begin{equation}
u^{\stepone,n+1}_{i,j} = u^{\stepone,n}_{i,j} +
\half\Delta t\left( 3f(u^{\stepone, n}_{i,j}, t_n) -
f(u^{\stepone, n-1}_{i,j}, t_{n-1})
\right)
\tp
\end{equation}
!et
We can use a Forward Euler step to start the method, i.e, compute
$u^{\stepone,1}_{i,j}$.

The algorithm goes like this:

 o Solve the diffusion problem for one time step as usual.
 o Solve the reaction ODEs at each mesh point in $[t_n,t_n+\Delta t]$,
   using the diffusion solution in 1. as initial condition.
   The solution of the ODEs constitute the solution of the original problem
   at the end of each time step.

We may use a much smaller time step when solving the reaction part, adapted
to the dynamics of the problem $u'=f(u)$. This gives great flexibility in
splitting methods.

[hpl: Can you make an example? I have started in `src/split_diffu_react.py`.]

===== Example: Reaction-Diffusion with linear reaction term =====
label{nonlin:splitting:RD_linearR}

These ideas may be illustrated by the following example, where we compute the
errors and convergence rates for three different numerical approaches when solving
the reaction-diffusion equation with a linear reaction term, i.e. $f(u) = -bu$.

In the implementation below, the equation is solved first without any splitting, 
simply using the forward Euler method over the whole time interval. Then, 
ordinary splitting is introduced and, finally, first order Strang splitting. With
each of the splitting approaches, a finer time stepping is made possible for 
the reaction part.

Running the code, shows that the convergence rate is 1 for all methods, which is
what one would expect. Also, the error gets smaller for the ordinary splitting 
approach compared to the forward Euler, and still smaller for the Strang splitting
compared to ordinary splitting. With either method, choosing to use an even finer
time stepping for the reaction term, gives a further reduction in the error without
affecting the convergence rate. 

The reaction step is here solved with the second order Adams-Bashforth method, which
in itself contributes to second order convergence. However, since our implementation
still uses forward Euler for the diffusion step, the overall convergence rate only 
becomes first order. Switching to, e.g., Crank-Nicolson with the theta rule will
allow an overall convergence rate of 2.

[sl: At the moment of writing, I am not sure whether we will include the CN via 
the theta rule. The code is there, but, as I say in my results file, I only get
first order convergence. I will finalize the text when this is resolved.]

===== Analysis of the splitting method =====

Let us address a linear PDE problem for which we can develop analytical
solutions of the discrete equations, with and without splitting, and discuss
these. Choosing $f(u)=-\beta u$ for a constant $\beta$ gives a linear
problem. We use the Forward Euler method for both the PDE and ODE problems.

We seek a 1D Fourier wave component solution of the problem, assuming
homogeneous Dirichlet conditions at $x=0$ and $x=L$:

!bt
\[ u = e^{-\dfc k^2 t - \beta t}\sin kx,\quad k = \frac{\pi}{L}\tp\]
!et
This component fits the 1D PDE problem ($f=0$). On complex form we can
write

!bt
\[ u = e^{-\dfc k^2 t - \beta t + ikx},\]
!et
where $i=\sqrt{-1}$ and the imaginary part is taken as the physical solution.

We refer to ref[Section ref{diffu:pde1:analysis}][ in
cite{Langtangen_Linge}][the section "Analysis of schemes for
the diffusion equation": "" in cite{Langtangen_Linge}] and to
the book cite{Langtangen_decay} for a discussion of exact numerical
solutions to diffusion and decay problems, respectively.  The key idea
is to search for solutions $A^ne^{ikx}$ and determine $A$.  For the
diffusion problem solved by a Forward Euler method one has

!bt
\[ A = 1 - 4F\sin^p, \]
!et
where $F=\dfc\Delta t/\Delta x^2$ is the mesh Fourier number and $p=k\Delta x/2$
is a dimensionless number reflecting the spatial resolution (number of points
per wave length in space). For the decay problem $u'=-\beta u$, we have
$A=1 - q$, where $q$ is a dimensionless parameter reflecting the resolution
in the decay problem: $q = \beta\Delta t$.

The original model problem can also be discretized by a Forward Euler scheme,

!bt
\[ [D^+_t u = \dfc D_xD_x u - \beta u]^n_i\tp\]
!et
Assuming $A^ne^{ikx}$ we find that

!bt
\[ u^n_i = (1 - 4F\sin^p -q)^n\sin kx\tp\]
!et
We are particularly interested in what happens at one time step. That is,

!bt
\[ u^{n}_{i} = (1-4F\sin^2 p)u^{n-1}_i\tp\]
!et

In the two stage algorithm, we first compute the diffusion step

!bt
\[ u^{\stepzero,n+1}_i = (1 - 4F\sin^2 p)u^{n-1}_i\tp\]
!et
Then we use this as input to the decay algorithm and arrive at

!bt
\[ u^{\stepone,n+1} = (1-q)u^{\stepzero,n+1} = (1-q)(1-4F\sin^2 p) u^{n-1}_i\tp\]
!et
The splitting approximation over one step is therefore

!bt
\[ E = 1 - 4F\sin^p -q - (1-q)(1-4F\sin^2 p) = -q(2 - F\sin^2 p)) \]
!et
