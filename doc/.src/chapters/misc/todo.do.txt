======= Diffusion equations =======

===== Diffusion PDE in 2D =====

__Task 1:__ Implement a 2D diffusion PDE solver for the $\theta$-rule
in time. Set up the matrix system first as a square matrix, then
as a sparse matrix. Solve system by Gaussian elimination.

There is a preliminary sparse matrix
code in `src-diffu/LeifRune/laplace.py`, but it
applies `scipy.sparse.spdiags` and we should apply `scipy.sparse.diags`
instead, see `src-diffu/diffu1D_u0.py` (`diags`) versus
`src-diffu/diffu1D_v1.py` (`spdiags`) for a corresponding 1D examples.

We need a verification example. I suggest extending the 1D example to

!bt
\[ u(x,y,t) = (L_x-x)(L_y-y)5t,\]
!et
which fulfills $u=0$ at the boundary. This solution should be exactly
reproduced by all schemes.
Then we can have convergence rates tests with
solutions of the form

!bt
\[ u(x,y,t) = e^{-pt}\cos qx\cos ry,\]
!et
with prescribed boundary conditions (as functions of time and space) for $u$.

__Task 2:__ Add a 2D diffusion PDE solver for the $\theta$-rule
in time using Conjugate Gradient method with ILU preconditioning.
Use `scipy.sparse` tools (make the sparse matrix in some format,
call ILU to make preconditioner and call the iterative solver).
This is *the* definite solver to present.
Exercise: extend to 3D.

===== Applications of diffusion equations =====

We need to write about various applications that results in diffusion PDEs.
See `wave_app*.do.txt ` for how we did this for the wave equation.

 * Quick derivation of diffusion of a substance: start with mass conservation and use Fick's law.
 * Quick derivation of diffusion of heat in solids: start with the energy equation, remove terms with stress work and convection, and use Fourier's law.
 * Diffusion PDEs arising from Navier-Stokes in simplified flow configurations. Some suggestions are in `diffu_app.do.txt`.
 * Quick intro to the cable equation for signals in the brain.
 * Fisher's equation for population growth with spatial diffusion,
   but this is a nonlinear equation... OK with Forward Euler.
 * Murray's Mathematical Biology book has many nonlinear diffusion PDEs
   for various bio applications.
