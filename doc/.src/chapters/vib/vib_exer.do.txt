# in vb_odespy examples: add 20 RK4 1000 to show RK4 in the long run

# mu'' + bu' + ku = F(t)
# set up analytical solution for reference
# compare for F = sin qt, demonstrate resonance by having
# F = sin q t and q = piecewise constant in time with four
# levels: 0.1, 0.75 1, 1.25, 2 of the resonance frequency,
# make each platou act for a while to see the effect

# mu'' + bu' + s(u) = F(t) as exercise, pendulum
# mu'' + f(x) + s() = F(t) via odespy RK4

# odespy: ForwardBackward on a 2n system? Need special formula for first
# step to ensure dt^2 accuracy there.

# apps: planet around a star, box horizontal and vertical, bumpy,
# jumping washing machine, pendulum, moored ship, look to Irgens
