======= Applications of vibration models =======
label{vib:app}

The following text derives some of the most well-known physical
problems that lead to second-order ODE models of the type addressed in
this ${DOCUMENT}.  We consider a simple spring-mass system; thereafter
extended with nonlinear spring, damping, and external excitation; a
spring-mass system with sliding friction; a simple and a physical
(classical) pendulum; and an elastic pendulum.

===== Oscillating mass attached to a spring =====
label{vib:app:mass_spring}

FIGURE: [fig-vib/oscillator_spring, width=500 frac=0.7] Simple oscillating mass. label{vib:app:mass_spring:fig}

The most fundamental mechanical vibration system is depicted in Figure
ref{vib:app:mass_spring:fig}. A body with mass $m$ is attached to a
spring and can move horizontally without friction (in the wheels). The
position of the body is given by the vector $\rpos(t) = u(t)\ii$, where
$\ii$ is a unit vector in $x$ direction.
There is
only one force acting on the body: a spring force $\F_s =-ku\ii$, where
$k$ is a constant. The point $x=0$, where $u=0$, must therefore
correspond to the body's position
where the spring is neither extended nor compressed, so the force
vanishes.

The basic physical principle that governs the motion of the body is
Newton's second law of motion: $\F=m\acc$, where
$\F$ is the sum of forces on the body, $m$ is its mass, and $\acc=\ddot\rpos$
is the acceleration. We use the dot for differentiation with respect
to time, which is
usual in mechanics. Newton's second law simplifies here
to $-\F_s=m\ddot u\ii$, which translates to

!bt
\[ -ku = m\ddot u\tp\]
!et
Two initial conditions are needed: $u(0)=I$, $\dot u(0)=V$.
The ODE problem is normally written as

!bt
\begin{equation}
m\ddot u + ku = 0,\quad u(0)=I,\ \dot u(0)=V\tp
label{vib:app:mass_spring:eqx}
\end{equation}
!et
It is
not uncommon to divide by $m$
and introduce the frequency $\omega = \sqrt{k/m}$:

!bt
\begin{equation}
\ddot u + \omega^2 u = 0,\quad u(0)=I,\  \dot u(0)=V\tp
label{vib:app:mass_spring:equ}
\end{equation}
!et
This is the model problem in the first part of this chapter, with the
small difference that we write the time derivative of $u$ with a dot
above, while we used $u^{\prime}$ and $u^{\prime\prime}$ in previous
parts of the ${DOCUMENT}.

idx{DOF (degree of freedom)}

Since only one scalar mathematical quantity, $u(t)$, describes the
complete motion, we say that the mechanical system has one degree of freedom
(DOF).

=== Scaling ===

For numerical simulations it is very convenient to scale
(ref{vib:app:mass_spring:equ}) and thereby get rid of the problem of
finding relevant values for all the parameters $m$, $k$, $I$, and $V$.
Since the amplitude of the oscillations are dictated by $I$ and $V$
(or more precisely, $V/\omega$), we scale $u$ by $I$ (or $V/\omega$ if
$I=0$):

!bt
\[ \bar u = \frac{u}{I},\quad \bar t = \frac{t}{t_c}\tp\]
!et
The time scale $t_c$ is normally chosen as the inverse period $2\pi/\omega$ or
angular frequency $1/\omega$, most often as $t_c=1/\omega$.
Inserting the dimensionless quantities $\bar u$ and $\bar t$ in
(ref{vib:app:mass_spring:equ}) results in the scaled problem

!bt
\[ \frac{d^2\bar u}{d\bar t^2} + \bar u = 0,\quad \bar u(0)=1,\ \frac{\bar u}{\bar t}(0)=\beta = \frac{V}{I\omega},\]
!et
where $\beta$ is a dimensionless number. Any motion that starts from rest
($V=0$) is free of parameters in the scaled model!

=== The physics ===

The typical physics of the system in Figure
ref{vib:app:mass_spring:fig} can be described as follows.  Initially,
we displace the body to some position $I$, say at rest ($V=0$). After
releasing the body, the spring, which is extended, will act with a
force $-kI\ii$ and pull the body to the left. This force causes an
acceleration and therefore increases velocity. The body passes the
point $x=0$, where $u=0$, and the spring will then be compressed and
act with a force $kx\ii$ against the motion and cause retardation. At
some point, the motion stops and the velocity is zero, before the
spring force $kx\ii$ has worked long enough to push the body in
positive direction. The result is that the body accelerates back and
forth. As long as there is no friction forces to damp the motion, the
oscillations will continue forever.

===== General mechanical vibrating system =====
label{vib:app:mass_gen}

FIGURE: [fig-vib/oscillator_general, width=500 frac=0.7] General oscillating system. label{vib:app:mass_gen:fig}

The mechanical system in Figure ref{vib:app:mass_spring:fig} can easily be
extended to the more general system in Figure ref{vib:app:mass_gen:fig},
where the body is attached to a spring and a dashpot, and also subject
to an environmental force $F(t)\ii$. The system has still only one
degree of freedom since the body can only move back and forth parallel to
the $x$ axis. The spring force was linear, $\F_s=-ku\ii$,
in Section ref{vib:app:mass_spring}, but in more general cases it can
depend nonlinearly on the position. We therefore set $\F_s=s(u)\ii$.
The dashpot, which acts
as a damper, results in a force $\F_d$ that depends on the body's
velocity $\dot u$ and that always acts against the motion.
The mathematical model of the force is written $\F_d =f(\dot u)\ii$.
A positive $\dot u$ must result in a force acting in the positive $x$
direction.
Finally, we have the external environmental force $\F_e = F(t)\ii$.

Newton's second law of motion now involves three forces:

!bt
\[ F(t)\ii + f(\dot u)\ii - s(u)\ii = m\ddot u \ii\tp\]
!et
The common mathematical form of the ODE problem is

!bt
\begin{equation}
m\ddot u + f(\dot u) + s(u) = F(t),\quad u(0)=I,\ \dot u(0)=V\tp
label{vib:app:mass_gen:equ}
\end{equation}
!et
This is the generalized problem treated in the last part of the
present chapter, but with prime denoting the derivative instead of the dot.

The most common models for the spring and dashpot are linear: $f(\dot u)
=b\dot u$ with a constant $b\geq 0$, and $s(u)=ku$ for a constant $k$.

=== Scaling ===

A specific scaling requires specific choices of $f$, $s$, and $F$.
Suppose we have

!bt
\[ f(\dot u) = b|\dot u|\dot u,\quad s(u)=ku,\quad F(t)=A\sin(\phi t)\tp\]
!et
We introduce dimensionless variables as usual, $\bar u = u/u_c$ and
$\bar t = t/t_c$. The scale $u_c$ depends both on the initial conditions
and $F$, but as time grows, the effect of the initial conditions die out
and $F$ will drive the motion. Inserting $\bar u$ and $\bar t$ in the
ODE gives

!bt
\[ m\frac{u_c}{t_c^2}\frac{d^2\bar u}{d\bar t^2}
+ b\frac{u_c^2}{t_c^2}\left\vert\frac{d\bar u}{d\bar t}\right\vert
\frac{d\bar u}{d\bar t} + ku_c\bar u = A\sin(\phi t_c\bar t)\tp\]
!et
We divide by $u_c/t_c^2$ and demand the coefficients of the
$\bar u$ and the forcing term from $F(t)$ to have unit coefficients.
This leads to the scales

!bt
\[ t_c = \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}},\quad u_c = \frac{A}{k}\tp\]
!et
The scaled ODE becomes

!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2\bar u}{d\bar t^2}
+ 2\beta\left\vert\frac{d\bar u}{d\bar t}\right\vert
\frac{d\bar u}{d\bar t} + \bar u = \sin(\gamma\bar t),
label{vib:app:mass_gen:scaled}
\end{equation}
!et
where there are two dimensionless numbers:

!bt
\[ \beta = \frac{Ab}{2mk},\quad\gamma =\phi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}\tp\]
!et
The $\beta$ number measures the size of the damping term (relative to unity)
and is assumed to be small, basically because $b$ is small. The $\phi$
number is the ratio of the time scale of free vibrations and the time scale
of the forcing.
The scaled initial conditions have two other dimensionless numbers
as values:

!bt
\[ \bar u(0) = \frac{Ik}{A},\quad \frac{d\bar u}{d\bar t}=\frac{t_c}{u_c}V = \frac{V}{A}\sqrt{mk}\tp\]
!et




===== A sliding mass attached to a spring =====
label{vib:app:mass_sliding}

Consider a variant of the oscillating body in Section ref{vib:app:mass_spring}
and Figure ref{vib:app:mass_spring:fig}: the body rests on a flat
surface, and there is sliding friction between the body and the surface.
Figure ref{vib:app:mass_sliding:fig} depicts the problem.

FIGURE: [fig-vib/oscillator_sliding, width=500 frac=0.7] Sketch of a body sliding on a surface. label{vib:app:mass_sliding:fig}

The body is attached to a spring with spring force $-s(u)\ii$.
The friction force is proportional to the normal force on the surface,
$-mg\jj$, and given by $-f(\dot u)\ii$, where

!bt
\[ f(\dot u) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
-\mu mg,& \dot u < 0,\\
\mu mg, & \dot u > 0,\\
0,      & \dot u=0
\end{array}\right.\]
!et
Here, $\mu$ is a friction coefficient. With the signum function

!bt
\[ \mbox{sign(x)} = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
-1,& x < 0,\\
1, & x > 0,\\
0, & x=0
\end{array}\right.\]
!et
we can simply write $f(\dot u) = \mu mg\,\hbox{sign}(\dot u)$
(the sign function is implemented by `numpy.sign`).

The equation of motion becomes

!bt
\begin{equation}
m\ddot u + \mu mg\hbox{sign}(\dot u) + s(u) = 0,\quad u(0)=I,\ \dot u(0)=V\tp
label{vib:app:mass_sliding:equ}
\end{equation}
!et


===== A jumping washing machine =====
label{vib:app:washmach}

A washing machine is placed on four springs with efficient dampers.
If the machine contains just a few clothes, the circular motion of
the machine induces a sinusoidal external force and the machine will
jump up and down if the frequency of the external force is close to
the natural frequency of the machine and its spring-damper system.

[hpl: Not finished. This is a good example on resonance.]



===== Motion of a pendulum =====
label{vib:app:pendulum}

=== Simple pendulum ===

A classical problem in mechanics is the motion of a pendulum. We first
consider a "simple pendulum" :
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum" (sometimes also called a
mathematical pendulum): a small body of mass $m$ is
attached to a massless wire and can oscillate back and forth in the
gravity field. Figure ref{vib:app:pendulum:fig_problem} shows a sketch
of the problem.

FIGURE: [fig-vib/pendulum_problem, width=300 frac=0.5] Sketch of a simple pendulum. label{vib:app:pendulum:fig_problem}

The motion is governed by Newton's 2nd law, so we need to find
expressions for the forces and the acceleration. Three forces on the
body are considered: an unknown force $S$ from the wire, the gravity
force $mg$, and an air resistance force, $\frac{1}{2}C_D\varrho A|v|v$,
hereafter called the drag force, directed against the velocity
of the body. Here, $C_D$ is a drag coefficient, $\varrho$ is the
density of air, $A$ is the cross section area of the body, and $v$ is
the magnitude of the velocity.

We introduce a coordinate system with polar coordinates and unit
vectors $\ir$ and $\ith$ as shown in Figure
ref{vib:app:pendulum:fig_forces}.  The position of the center of mass
of the body is

!bt
\[ \rpos(t) = x_0\ii + y_0\jj + L\ir,\]
!et
where $\ii$ and $\jj$ are unit vectors in the corresponding Cartesian
coordinate system in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively. We have
that $\ir = \cos\theta\ii +\sin\theta\jj$.

FIGURE: [fig-vib/pendulum_forces, width=500 frac=0.65] Forces acting on a simple pendulum. label{vib:app:pendulum:fig_forces}

The forces are now expressed as follows.

 * Wire force: $-S\ir$
 * Gravity force: $-mg\jj = mg(-\sin\theta\,\ith + \cos\theta\,\ir)$
 * Drag force: $-\frac{1}{2}C_D\varrho A |v|v\,\ith$

Since a positive velocity means movement in the direction of $\ith$,
the drag force must be directed along $-\ith$ so it works against the
motion. We assume motion in air so that the added mass effect can
be neglected (for a spherical body, the added mass is $\half\varrho V$,
where $V$ is the volume of the body). Also the buoyancy effect
can be neglected for motion in the air when the density difference
between the fluid and the body is so significant.

The velocity of the body is found from $\rpos$:

!bt
\[ \v(t) = \dot\rpos (t) = \frac{d}{d\theta}(x_0\ii + y_0\jj + L\ir)\frac{d\theta}{dt} = L\dot\theta\ith,\]
!et
since $\frac{d}{d\theta}\ir = \ith$. It follows that $v=|\v|=L\dot\theta$.
The acceleration is

!bt
\[ \acc(t) = \dot\v(r) = \frac{d}{dt}(L\dot\theta\ith)
= L\ddot\theta\ith + L\dot\theta\frac{d\ith}{d\theta}\dot\theta =
= L\ddot\theta\ith - L\dot\theta^2\ir,\]
!et
since $\frac{d}{d\theta}\ith = -\ir$.

Newton's 2nd law of motion becomes

!bt
\[ -S\ir + mg(-\sin\theta\,\ith + \cos\theta\,\ir) -
\frac{1}{2}C_D\varrho AL^2|\dot\theta|\dot\theta\,\ith
= mL\ddot\theta\dot\theta\,\ith - L\dot\theta^2\ir,\]
!et
leading to two component equations

!bt
\begin{align}
-S + mg\cos\theta &= -L\dot\theta^2,
label{vib:app:pendulum:ir}\\
-mg\sin\theta - \frac{1}{2}C_D\varrho AL^2|\dot\theta|\dot\theta
&= mL\ddot\theta\tp
label{vib:app:pendulum:ith}
\end{align}
!et
From (ref{vib:app:pendulum:ir}) we get an expression for
$S=mg\cos\theta + L\dot\theta^2$, and from (ref{vib:app:pendulum:ith})
we get a differential equation for the angle $\theta(t)$. This latter
equation is ordered as

!bt
\begin{equation}
m\ddot\theta + \frac{1}{2}C_D\varrho AL|\dot\theta|\dot\theta
+ \frac{mg}{L}\sin\theta = 0\tp
label{vib:app:pendulum:thetaeq}
\end{equation}
!et
Two initial conditions are needed: $\theta=\Theta$ and $\dot\theta = \Omega$.
Normally, the pendulum motion is started from rest, which means $\Omega =0$.

Equation (ref{vib:app:pendulum:thetaeq}) fits the general model
used in (ref{vib:ode2}) in Section ref{vib:model2} if we define
$u=\theta$, $f(u^{\prime}) = \frac{1}{2}C_D\varrho AL|\dot u|\dot u$,
$s(u) = L^{-1}mg\sin u$, and $F=0$.
If the body is a sphere with radius $R$, we can take $C_D=0.4$ and $A=\pi R^2$.
Exercise ref{vib:exer:pendulum_simple} asks you to scale the equations
and carry out specific simulations with this model.

=== Physical pendulum ===

The motion of a compound or physical pendulum where the wire is a rod with
mass, can be modeled very similarly. The governing equation is
$I\acc = \bm{T}$ where $I$ is the moment of inertia of the entire body about
the point $(x_0,y_0)$, and $\bm{T}$ is the sum of moments of the forces
with respect to $(x_0,y_0)$. The vector equation reads

!bt
\[ \rpos\times(-S\ir + mg(-\sin\theta\ith + \cos\theta\ir) -
\frac{1}{2}C_D\varrho AL^2|\dot\theta|\dot\theta\ith)
= I(L\ddot\theta\dot\theta\ith - L\dot\theta^2\ir)\tp\]
!et
The component equation in $\ith$ direction gives the equation of motion
for $\theta(t)$:

!bt
\begin{equation}
I\ddot\theta + \frac{1}{2}C_D\varrho AL^3|\dot\theta|\dot\theta
+ mgL\sin\theta = 0\tp
label{vib:app:pendulum:thetaeq_physical}
\end{equation}
!et

===== Dynamic free body diagram during pendulum motion =====
label{vib:app:pendulum_bodydia}

Usually one plots the mathematical quantities as functions of time to
visualize the solution of ODE models.  Exercise
ref{vib:exer:pendulum_simple} asks you to do this for the motion of a
pendulum in the previous section.  However, sometimes it is more
instructive to look at other types of visualizations. For example, we
have the pendulum and the free body diagram in Figures
ref{vib:app:pendulum:fig_problem} and
ref{vib:app:pendulum:fig_forces}. We may think of these figures as
animations in time instead. Especially the free body diagram will show both the
motion of the pendulum *and* the size of the forces during the motion.
The present section exemplifies how to make such a dynamic body
diagram.
% if FORMAT == 'pdflatex':
Two typical snapshots of free body diagrams are displayed below
(the drag force is magnified 5 times to become more visual!).

% endif

Dynamic physical sketches, coupled to the numerical solution of
differential equations, requires a program to produce a sketch for
the situation at each time level.
"Pysketcher": "https://github.com/hplgit/pysketcher" is such a tool.
In fact (and not surprising!) Figures ref{vib:app:pendulum:fig_problem} and
ref{vib:app:pendulum:fig_forces} were drawn using Pysketcher.
The details of the drawings are explained in the
"Pysketcher tutorial": "http://hplgit.github.io/pysketcher/doc/web/index.html".
Here, we outline how this type of sketch can be used to create an animated
free body diagram during the motion of a pendulum.

Pysketcher is actually a layer of useful abstractions on top of
standard plotting packages. This means that we in fact apply Matplotlib
to make the animated free body diagram, but instead of dealing with a wealth
of detailed Matplotlib commands, we can express the drawing in terms of
more high-level objects, e.g., objects for the wire, angle $\theta$,
body with mass $m$, arrows for forces, etc. When the position of these
objects are given through variables, we can just couple those variables
to the dynamic solution of our ODE and thereby make a unique drawing
for each $\theta$ value in a simulation.

=== Writing the solver ===

Let us start with the most familiar part of the current problem:
writing the solver function. We use Odespy for this purpose.
We also work with dimensionless equations. Since $\theta$ can be
viewed as dimensionless, we only need to introduce a dimensionless time,
here taken as $\bar t = t/\sqrt{L/g}$.
The resulting dimensionless mathematical model for $\theta$,
the dimensionless angular velocity $\omega$, the
dimensionless wire force $\bar S$, and the dimensionless
drag force $\bar D$ is then

!bt
\begin{align}
\frac{d\omega}{d\bar t} &= - \alpha|\omega|\omega - \sin\theta,
label{vib:app:pendulum_bodydia:eqth}\\
\frac{d\theta}{d\bar t} &= \omega,
label{vib:app:pendulum_bodydia:eqomega}\\
\bar S &= \omega^2 + \cos\theta,
label{vib:app:pendulum_bodydia:eqS}\\
\bar D &= -\alpha |\omega|\omega,
label{vib:app:pendulum_bodydia:eqD}
\end{align}
!et
with

!bt
\[ \alpha = \frac{C_D\varrho\pi R^2L}{2m}\tp\]
!et
as a dimensionless parameter expressing the ratio of the drag force and
the gravity force. The dimensionless $\omega$ is made non-dimensional
by the time, so $\omega\sqrt{L/g}$ is the corresponding angular
frequency with dimensions.
#Exercise ref{vib:exer:pendulum_simple} asks you to carry out the details of
#the scaling.

A suitable function for computing
(ref{vib:app:pendulum_bodydia:eqth})-(ref{vib:app:pendulum_bodydia:eqD})
is listed below.

=== Drawing the free body diagram ===

The `sketch` function below applies Pysketcher objects to build
a diagram like that in Figure ref{vib:app:pendulum:fig_forces},
except that we have removed the rotation point $(x_0,y_0)$ and
the unit vectors in polar coordinates as these objects are not
important for an animated free body diagram.

@@@CODE src-vib/pendulum_body_diagram.py fromto: import sys@def simulate

=== Making the animated free body diagram ===

It now remains to couple the `simulate` and `sketch` functions.
We first run `simulate`:

!bc pycod
from math import pi, radians, degrees
import numpy as np
alpha = 0.4
period = 2*pi   # Use small theta approximation
T = 12*period   # Simulate for 12 periods
dt = period/40  # 40 time steps per period
a = 70          # Initial amplitude in degrees
Theta = radians(a)

t, theta, omega, S, drag = simulate(alpha, Theta, dt, T)
!ec
The next step is to run through the time levels in the simulation and
make a sketch at each level:

!bc pycod
for time_level, t_ in enumerate(t):
    sketch(theta, S, mg, drag, t_, time_level)
!ec
The individual sketches are (by the `sketch` function) saved in files
with names `tmp_%04d.png`. These can be combined to videos using
(e.g.) `ffmpeg`. A complete function `animate` for running the
simulation and creating video files is
listed below.

===== Motion of an elastic pendulum =====
label{vib:app:pendulum_elastic}

Consider a pendulum as in Figure ref{vib:app:pendulum:fig_problem}, but
this time the wire is elastic. The length of the wire when it is not
stretched is $L_0$, while $L(t)$ is the stretched
length at time $t$ during the motion.

Stretching the elastic wire a distance $\Delta L$ gives rise to a
spring force $k\Delta L$ in the opposite direction of the
stretching. Let $\normalvec$ be a unit normal vector along the wire
from the point $\rpos_0=(x_0,y_0)$ and in the direction of $\ith$, see
Figure ref{vib:app:pendulum:fig_forces} for definition of $(x_0,y_0)$
and $\ith$. Obviously, we have $\normalvec=\ith$, but in this modeling
of an elastic pendulum we do not need polar coordinates.  Instead, it
is more straightforward to develop the equation in Cartesian
coordinates.

A mathematical expression for $\normalvec$ is

!bt
\[ \normalvec = \frac{\rpos-\rpos_0}{L(t)},\]
!et
where $L(t)=||\rpos-\rpos_0||$ is the current length of the elastic wire.
The position vector $\rpos$ in Cartesian coordinates reads
$\rpos(t) = x(t)\ii + y(t)\jj$, where $\ii$ and $\jj$ are unit vectors
in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively.
It is convenient to introduce the Cartesian components $n_x$ and $n_y$
of the normal vector:

!bt
\[ \normalvec = \frac{\rpos-\rpos_0}{L(t)} = \frac{x(t)-x_0}{L(t)}\ii + \frac{y(t)-y_0}{L(t)}\jj = n_x\ii + n_y\jj\tp\]
!et

The stretch $\Delta L$ in the wire is

!bt
\[ \Delta t = L(t) - L_0\tp\]
!et
The force in the wire is then $-S\normalvec=-k\Delta L\normalvec$.

The other forces are the gravity and the air resistance, just as in
Figure ref{vib:app:pendulum:fig_forces}. For motion in air we can
neglect the added mass and buoyancy effects.  The main difference is
that we have a *model* for $S$ in terms of the motion (as soon as we
have expressed $\Delta L$ by $\rpos$). For simplicity, we drop the air
resistance term (but Exercise ref{vib:exer:pendulum_elastic_drag} asks
you to include it).

Newton's second law of motion applied to the body now results in

!bt
\begin{equation}
m\ddot\rpos = -k(L-L_0)\normalvec - mg\jj
label{vib:app:pendulum_elastic:eq1}
\end{equation}
!et
The two components of
(ref{vib:app:pendulum_elastic:eq1}) are

!bt
\begin{align}
\ddot x &= -\frac{k}{m}(L-L_0)n_x,\\
label{vib:app:pendulum_elastic:eq2a} \\
\ddot y &= - \frac{k}{m}(L-L_0)n_y - g
label{vib:app:pendulum_elastic:eq2b}\tp
\end{align}
!et

=== Remarks about an elastic vs a non-elastic pendulum ===

Note that the derivation of the ODEs for an elastic pendulum is more
straightforward than for a classical, non-elastic pendulum,
since we avoid the details
with polar coordinates, but instead work with Newton's second law
directly in Cartesian coordinates. The reason why we can do this is that
the elastic pendulum undergoes a general two-dimensional motion where
all the forces are known or expressed as functions of $x(t)$ and $y(t)$,
such that we get two ordinary differential equations.
The motion of the non-elastic pendulum, on the other hand, is constrained:
the body has to move along a circular path, and the force $S$ in the
wire is unknown.

The non-elastic pendulum therefore leads to
a *differential-algebraic* equation, i.e., ODEs for $x(t)$ and $y(t)$
combined with an extra constraint $(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2 = L^2$
ensuring that the motion takes place along a circular path.
The extra constraint (equation) is compensated by an extra unknown force
$-S\normalvec$. Differential-algebraic equations are normally hard
to solve, especially with pen and paper.
Fortunately, for the non-elastic pendulum we can do a
trick: in polar coordinates the unknown force $S$ appears only in the
radial component of Newton's second law, while the unknown
degree of freedom for describing the motion, the angle $\theta(t)$,
is completely governed by the asimuthal component. This allows us to
decouple the unknowns $S$ and $\theta$. But this is a kind of trick and
not a widely applicable method. With an elastic pendulum we use straightforward
reasoning with Newton's 2nd law and arrive at a standard ODE problem that
(after scaling) is easy solve on a computer.

=== Initial conditions ===

What is the initial position of the body? We imagine that first the
pendulum hangs in equilibrium in its vertical position, and then it is
displaced an angle $\Theta$. The equilibrium position is governed
by the ODEs with the accelerations set to zero.
The $x$ component leads to $x(t)=x_0$, while the $y$ component gives

!bt
\[ 0 = - \frac{k}{m}(L-L_0)n_y - g = \frac{k}{m}(L(0)-L_0) - g\quad\Rightarrow\quad
L(0) = L_0 + mg/k,\]
!et
since $n_y=-11$ in this position. The corresponding $y$ value is then
from $n_y=-1$:

!bt
\[ y(t) = y_0 - L(0) = y_0 - (L_0 + mg/k)\tp\]
!et
Let us now choose $(x_0,y_0)$ such that the body is at the origin
in the equilibrium position:

!bt
\[ x_0 =0,\quad y_0 = L_0 + mg/k\tp\]
!et

Displacing the body an angle $\Theta$ to the right leads to the
initial position

!bt
\[ x(0)=(L_0+mg/k)\sin\Theta,\quad y(0)=(L_0+mg/k)(1-\cos\Theta)\tp\]
!et
The initial velocities can be set to zero: $x'(0)=y'(0)=0$.

=== The complete ODE problem ===

We can summarize all the equations as follows:

!bt
\begin{align*}
\ddot x &= -\frac{k}{m}(L-L_0)n_x,
\\
\ddot y &= -\frac{k}{m}(L-L_0)n_y - g,
\\
L &= \sqrt{(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2},
\\
n_x &= \frac{x-x_0}{L},
\\
n_y &= \frac{y-y_0}{L},
\\
x(0) &= (L_0+mg/k)\sin\Theta,
\\
x'(0) &= 0,
\\
y(0) & =(L_0+mg/k)(1-\cos\Theta),
\\
y'(0) &= 0\tp
\end{align*}
!et
We insert $n_x$ and $n_y$  in the ODEs:

!bt
\begin{align}
\ddot x &= -\frac{k}{m}\left(1 -\frac{L_0}{L}\right)(x-x_0),
label{vib:app:pendulum_elastic:x}\\
\ddot y &= -\frac{k}{m}\left(1 -\frac{L_0}{L}\right)(y-y_0) - g,
label{vib:app:pendulum_elastic:y}\\
L &= \sqrt{(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2},
label{vib:app:pendulum_elastic:L}\\
x(0) &= (L_0+mg/k)\sin\Theta,
label{vib:app:pendulum_elastic:x0}\\
x'(0) &= 0,
label{vib:app:pendulum_elastic:vx0}\\
y(0) & =(L_0+mg/k)(1-\cos\Theta),
label{vib:app:pendulum_elastic:y0}\\
y'(0) &= 0\tp
label{vib:app:pendulum_elastic:vy0}
\end{align}
!et

=== Scaling ===

The elastic pendulum model can be used to study both an elastic pendulum
and a classic, non-elastic pendulum. The latter problem is obtained
by letting $k\rightarrow\infty$. Unfortunately,
a serious problem with the ODEs
(ref{vib:app:pendulum_elastic:x})-(ref{vib:app:pendulum_elastic:y}) is that for large $k$, we have a very large factor $k/m$ multiplied by a
very small number $1-L_0/L$, since for large $k$, $L\approx L_0$ (very
small deformations of the wire). The product is subject to
significant round-off errors for many relevant physical values of
the parameters. To circumvent the problem, we introduce a scaling. This
will also remove physical parameters from the problem such that we end
up with only one dimensionless parameter,
closely related to the elasticity of the wire. Simulations can then be
done by setting just this dimensionless parameter.

The characteristic length can be taken such that in equilibrium, the
scaled length is unity, i.e., the characteristic length is $L_0+mg/k$:

!bt
\[ \bar x = \frac{x}{L_0+mg/k},\quad \bar y = \frac{y}{L_0+mg/k}\tp\]
!et
We must then also work with the scaled length $\bar L = L/(L_0+mg/k)$.

Introducing $\bar t=t/t_c$, where $t_c$ is a characteristic time we
have to decide upon later, one gets

!bt
\begin{align*}
\frac{d^2\bar x}{d\bar t^2} &=
-t_c^2\frac{k}{m}\left(1 -\frac{L_0}{L_0+mg/k}\frac{1}{\bar L}\right)\bar x,\\
\frac{d^2\bar y}{d\bar t^2} &=
-t_c^2\frac{k}{m}\left(1 -\frac{L_0}{L_0+mg/k}\frac{1}{\bar L}\right)(\bar y-1)
-t_c^2\frac{g}{L_0 + mg/k},\\
\bar L &= \sqrt{\bar x^2 + (\bar y-1)^2},\\
\bar x(0) &= \sin\Theta,\\
\bar x'(0) &= 0,\\
\bar y(0) & = 1 - \cos\Theta,\\
\bar y'(0) &= 0\tp
\end{align*}
!et
For a non-elastic pendulum with small angles, we know that the
frequency of the oscillations are $\omega = \sqrt{L/g}$. It is therefore
natural to choose a similar expression here, either the length in
the equilibrium position,

!bt
\[ t_c^2 = \frac{L_0+mg/k}{g}\tp\]
!et
or simply the unstretched length,

!bt
\[ t_c^2 = \frac{L_0}{g}\tp\]
!et
These quantities are not very different (since the elastic model
is valid only for quite small elongations), so we take the latter as it is
the simplest one.

The ODEs become

!bt
\begin{align*}
\frac{d^2\bar x}{d\bar t^2} &=
-\frac{L_0k}{mg}\left(1 -\frac{L_0}{L_0+mg/k}\frac{1}{\bar L}\right)\bar x,\\
\frac{d^2\bar y}{d\bar t^2} &=
-\frac{L_0k}{mg}\left(1 -\frac{L_0}{L_0+mg/k}\frac{1}{\bar L}\right)(\bar y-1)
-\frac{L_0}{L_0 + mg/k},\\
\bar L &= \sqrt{\bar x^2 + (\bar y-1)^2}\tp
\end{align*}
!et
We can now identify a dimensionless number

!bt
\[ \beta = \frac{L_0}{L_0 + mg/k} = \frac{1}{1+\frac{mg}{L_0k}},\]
!et
which is the ratio of the unstretched length and the
stretched length in equilibrium. The non-elastic pendulum will have
$\beta =1$ ($k\rightarrow\infty$).
With $\beta$ the ODEs read

!bt
\begin{align}
\frac{d^2\bar x}{d\bar t^2} &=
-\frac{\beta}{1-\beta}\left(1- \frac{\beta}{\bar L}\right)\bar x,
label{vib:app:pendulum_elastic:x:s}\\
\frac{d^2\bar y}{d\bar t^2} &=
-\frac{\beta}{1-\beta}\left(1- \frac{\beta}{\bar L}\right)(\bar y-1)
-\beta,
label{vib:app:pendulum_elastic:y:s}\\
\bar L &= \sqrt{\bar x^2 + (\bar y-1)^2},
label{vib:app:pendulum_elastic:L:s}\\
\bar x(0) &= (1+\epsilon)\sin\Theta,
label{vib:app:pendulum_elastic:x0:s}\\
\frac{d\bar x}{d\bar t}(0) &= 0,
label{vib:app:pendulum_elastic:vx0:s}\\
\bar y(0) &= 1 - (1+\epsilon)\cos\Theta,
label{vib:app:pendulum_elastic:y0:s}\\
\frac{d\bar y}{d\bar t}(0) &= 0,
label{vib:app:pendulum_elastic:vy0:s}
\end{align}
!et
We have here added a parameter $\epsilon$, which is an additional
downward stretch of the wire at $t=0$. This parameter makes it possible
to do a desired test: vertical oscillations of the pendulum. Without
$\epsilon$, starting the motion from $(0,0)$ with zero velocity will
result in $x=y=0$ for all times (also a good test!), but with
an initial stretch so the body's position is $(0,\epsilon)$, we
will have oscillatory vertical motion with amplitude $\epsilon$ (see
Exercise ref{vib:exer:pendulum_elastic}).

=== Remark on the non-elastic limit ===

We immediately see that as $k\rightarrow\infty$ (i.e., we obtain a non-elastic
pendulum), $\beta\rightarrow 1$, $\bar L\rightarrow 1$, and we have
very small values $1-\beta\bar L^{-1}$ divided by very small values
$1-\beta$ in the ODEs. However, it turns out that we can set $\beta$
very close to one and obtain a path of the body that within the visual
accuracy of a plot does not show any elastic oscillations.
(Should the division of very small values become a problem, one can
study the limit by L'Hospital's rule:

!bt
\[ \lim_{\beta\rightarrow 1}\frac{1 - \beta \bar L^{-1}}{1-\beta}
= \frac{1}{\bar L},\]
!et
and use the limit $\bar L^{-1}$ in the ODEs for $\beta$ values very
close to 1.)

===== Vehicle on a bumpy road =====
label{vib:app:bumpy}

FIGURE: [fig-vib/bumpy_sketch, width=400 frac=0.6] Sketch of one-wheel vehicle on a bumpy road. label{vib:app:bumpy:fig:sketch}

We consider a very simplistic vehicle, on one wheel, rolling along a
bumpy road. The oscillatory nature of the road will induce an external
forcing on the spring system in the vehicle and cause vibrations.
Figure ref{vib:app:bumpy:fig:sketch} outlines the situation.

To derive the equation that governs the motion, we must first establish
the position vector of the black mass at the top of the spring.
Suppose the spring has length $L$ without any elongation or compression,
suppose the radius of the wheel is $R$, and suppose the height of the
black mass at the top is $H$. With the aid of the $\rpos_0$ vector
in Figure ref{vib:app:bumpy:fig:sketch}, the position $\rpos$ of
the center point of the mass is

!bt
\begin{equation}
\rpos = \rpos_0 + 2R\jj + L\jj + u\jj + \half H\jj,\
\end{equation}
!et
where $u$ is the elongation or compression in the spring according to
the (unknown and to be computed) vertical displacement $u$ relative to the
road. If the vehicle travels
with constant horizontal velocity $v$ and $h(x)$ is the shape of the
road, then the vector $\rpos_0$ is

!bt
\[ \rpos_0 = vt\ii + h(vt)\jj,\]
!et
if the motion starts from $x=0$ at time $t=0$.

The forces on the mass is the gravity, the spring force, and an optional
damping force that is proportional to the vertical velocity $\dot u$. Newton's
second law of motion then tells that

!bt
\[ m\ddot\rpos = -mg\jj - s(u) - b\dot u\jj\tp\]
!et
This leads to

!bt
\[
m\ddot u = - s(u) - b\dot u - mg -mh''(vt)v^2
\]
!et

To simplify a little bit, we omit the gravity force $mg$ in comparison with
the other terms. Introducing $u'$ for $\dot u$ then gives a standard
damped, vibration equation with external forcing:

!bt
\begin{equation}
mu'' + bu' + s(u) =  -mh''(vt)v^2\tp
\end{equation}
!et
Since the road is normally known just as a set of array values, $h''$ must
be computed by finite differences. Let $\Delta x$ be the spacing between
measured values $h_i= h(i\Delta x)$ on the road. The discrete second-order
derivative $h''$ reads

!bt
\[ q_i = \frac{h_{i-1} - 2h_i + h_{i+1}}{\Delta x^2}, \quad i=1,\ldots,N_x-1\tp\]
!et
We may for maximum simplicity set
the end points as $q_0=q_1$ and $q_{N_x}=q_{N_x-1}$.
The term $-mh''(vt)v^2$ corresponds to a force with discrete time values

!bt
\[ F^n = -mq_n v^2,\quad \Delta t = v^{-1}\Delta x\tp\]
!et
This force can be directly used in a numerical model

!bt
\[ [mD_tD_t u + bD_{2t} u + s(u) = F]^n\tp\]
!et
Software for computing $u$ and also making an animated sketch of
the motion like we did in Section ref{vib:app:pendulum_bodydia}
is found in a separate project on the web:

===== Bouncing ball =====
label{vib:app:bouncing_ball}

A bouncing ball is a ball in free vertically fall until it impacts the
ground, but during the impact, some kinetic energy is lost, and a new
motion upwards with reduced velocity starts. After the motion is retarded,
a new free fall starts, and the process is repeated. At some point the
velocity close to the ground is so small that the ball is considered
to be finally at rest.

The motion of the ball falling in air is governed by Newton's second
law $F=ma$, where $a$ is the acceleration of the body, $m$ is the mass,
and $F$ is the sum of all forces. Here, we neglect the air resistance
so that gravity $-mg$ is the only force. The height of the ball is
denoted by $h$ and $v$ is the velocity. The relations between $h$, $v$, and
$a$,

!bt
\[ h'(t)= v(t),\quad v'(t) = a(t),\]
!et
combined with Newton's second law gives the ODE model

!bt
\begin{equation}
h^{\prime\prime}(t) = -g,
label{vib:app:bouncing:ball:h2eq}
\end{equation}
!et
or expressed alternatively as a system of first-order equations:

!bt
\begin{align}
v'(t) &= -g,
label{vib:app:bouncing:ball:veq} \\
h'(t) &= v(t)\tp
label{vib:app:bouncing:ball:heq}
\end{align}
!et
These equations govern the motion as long as the ball is away from
the ground by a small distance $\epsilon_h > 0$. When $h<\epsilon_h$,
we have two cases.

 o The ball impacts the ground, recognized by a sufficiently large negative
   velocity ($v<-\epsilon_v$). The velocity then changes sign and is
   reduced by a factor $C_R$, known as the "coefficient of restitution":
   "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_restitution".
   For plotting purposes, one may set $h=0$.
 o The motion stops, recognized by a sufficiently small velocity
   ($|v|<\epsilon_v$) close to the ground.

===== Two-body gravitational problem =====
label{vib:app:gravitation}

Consider two astronomical objects $A$ and $B$ that attract each other
by gravitational forces. $A$ and $B$ could be two stars in a binary
system, a planet orbiting a star, or a moon orbiting a planet.
Each object is acted upon by the
gravitational force due to the other object. Consider motion in a plane
(for simplicity) and let $(x_A,y_A)$ and $(x_B,y_B)$ be the
positions of object $A$ and $B$, respectively.

=== The governing equations ===

Newton's second law of motion applied to each object is all we need
to set up a mathematical model for this physical problem:

!bt
\begin{align}
m_A\ddot\x_A &= \F,\\
m_B\ddot\x_B &= -\F,
\end{align}
!et
where $F$ is the gravitational force

!bt
\[ \F = \frac{Gm_Am_B}{||\rpos||^3}\rpos,\]
!et
where

!bt
\[ \rpos(t) = \x_B(t) - \x_A(t),\]
!et
and $G$ is the gravitational constant:
$G=6.674\cdot 10^{-11}\hbox{ Nm}^2/\hbox{kg}^2$.

=== Scaling ===

A problem with these equations is that the parameters are very large
($m_A$, $m_B$, $||\rpos||$) or very small ($G$). The rotation time
for binary stars can be very small and large as well. It is therefore
advantageous to scale the equations.
A natural length scale could be the initial distance between the objects:
$L=\rpos(0)$. We write the dimensionless quantities as

!bt
\[ \bar\x_A = \frac{\x_A}{L},\quad\bar\x_B = \frac{\x_B}{L},\quad
\bar t = \frac{t}{t_c}\tp\]
!et
The gravity force is transformed to

!bt
\[ \F = \frac{Gm_Am_B}{L^2||\bar\rpos||^3}\bar\rpos,\quad \bar\rpos = \bar\x_B - \bar\x_A,\]
!et
so the first ODE for $\x_A$ becomes

!bt
\[ \frac{d^2 \bar\x_A}{d\bar t^2} =
\frac{Gm_Bt_c^2}{L^3}\frac{\bar\rpos}{||\bar\rpos||^3}\tp\]
!et
Assuming that quantities with a bar and their derivatives are around unity
in size, it is natural to choose $t_c$ such that the fraction $Gm_Bt_c/L^2=1$:

!bt
\[ t_c = \sqrt{\frac{L^3}{Gm_B}}\tp\]
!et
From the other equation for $\x_B$ we get another candidate for $t_c$ with
$m_A$ instead of $m_B$. Which mass we choose play a role if $m_A\ll m_B$ or
$m_B\ll m_A$. One solution is to use the sum of the masses:

!bt
\[ t_c = \sqrt{\frac{L^3}{G(m_A+m_B)}}\tp\]
!et
Taking a look at "Kepler's laws": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion" of planetary motion, the orbital period for a planet around the star is given by the $t_c$ above, except for a missing factor of $2\pi$,
but that means that $t_c^{-1}$ is just the angular frequency of the motion.
Our characteristic time $t_c$ is therefore highly relevant.
Introducing the dimensionless number

!bt
\[ \alpha = \frac{m_A}{m_B},\]
!et
we can write the dimensionless ODE as

!bt
\begin{align}
\frac{d^2 \bar\x_A}{d\bar t^2} &=
\frac{1}{1+\alpha}\frac{\bar\rpos}{||\bar\rpos||^3},\\
\frac{d^2 \bar\x_B}{d\bar t^2} &=
\frac{1}{1+\alpha^{-1}}\frac{\bar\rpos}{||\bar\rpos||^3}\tp
\end{align}
!et

In the limit $m_A\ll m_B$, i.e., $\alpha\ll 1$,
object B stands still, say $\bar\x_B=0$, and object
A orbits according to

!bt
\[ \frac{d^2 \bar\x_A}{d\bar t^2} = -\frac{\bar\x_A}{||\bar \x_A||^3}\tp\]
!et

=== Solution in a special case: planet orbiting a star ===

To better see the motion, and that our scaling is reasonable,
we introduce polar coordinates $r$ and $\theta$:

!bt
\[ \bar\x_A = r\cos\theta\ii + r\sin\theta\jj,\]
!et
which means $\bar\x_A$ can be written as $\bar\x_A =r\ir$. Since

!bt
\[ \frac{d}{dt}\ir = \dot\theta\ith,\quad \frac{d}{dt}\ith = -\dot\theta\ir,\]
!et
we have

!bt
\[ \frac{d^2 \bar\x_A}{d\bar t^2} =
(\ddot r - r\dot\theta^2)\ir + (r\ddot\theta + 2\dot r\dot\theta)\ith\tp
\]
!et
The equation of motion for mass A is then

!bt
\begin{align*}
\ddot r - r\dot\theta^2 &= -\frac{1}{r^2},\\
r\ddot\theta + 2\dot r\dot\theta &= 0\tp
\end{align*}
!et
The special case of circular motion, $r=1$, fulfills the equations, since
the latter equation then gives $\dot\theta =\hbox{const}$ and
the former then gives $\dot\theta = 1$, i.e., the motion is
$r(t)=1$, $\theta(t)=t$, with unit angular frequency as expected and
period $2\pi$ as expected.


===== Electric circuits =====

Although the term ``mechanical vibrations'' is used in the present
book, we must mention that the same type of equations arise
when modeling electric circuits.
The current $I(t)$ in a
circuit with an inductor with inductance $L$, a capacitor with
capacitance $C$, and overall resistance $R$, is governed by

!bt
\begin{equation}
\ddot I + \frac{R}{L}\dot I + \frac{1}{LC}I = \dot V(t),
\end{equation}
!et
where $V(t)$ is the voltage source powering the circuit.
This equation has the same form as the general model considered in
Section ref{vib:model2} if we set $u=I$, $f(u^{\prime})=bu^{\prime}$
and define $b=R/L$, $s(u) = L^{-1}C^{-1}u$, and $F(t)=\dot V(t)$.

======= Exercises =======

===== Exercise: Simulate resonance =====
label{vib:exer:resonance}
file=resonance

idx{resonance}

We consider the scaled ODE model
(ref{vib:app:mass_gen:scaled}) from Section ref{vib:app:mass_gen}.
After scaling, the amplitude of $u$ will have a size about unity
as time grows and the effect of the initial conditions die out due
to damping. However, as $\gamma\rightarrow 1$, the amplitude of $u$
increases, especially if $\beta$ is small. This effect is called
*resonance*. The purpose of this exercise is to explore resonance.

!bsubex
Figure out how the `solver` function in `vib.py` can be called
for the scaled ODE (ref{vib:app:mass_gen:scaled}).

!bsol
Comparing the scaled ODE (ref{vib:app:mass_gen:scaled})
with the ODE (ref{vib:app:mass_gen:equ}) with dimensions, we
realize that the parameters in the latter must be set as

 * $m=1$
 * $f(\dot u) = 2\beta |\dot u|\dot u$
 * $s(u)=ku$
 * $F(t)=\sin(\gamma t)$
 * $I=Ik/A$
 * $V=\sqrt{mk}V/A$

The expected period is $2\pi$, so simulating for $N$ periods means
$T=2\pi N$. Having $m$ time steps per period means $\Delta t = 2\pi/m$.

Suppose we just choose $I=1$ and $V=0$. Simulating for 20 periods with
60 time steps per period, implies the following
`solver` call to run the scaled model:

!bc pycod
u, t = solver(I=1, V=0, m=1, b=2*beta, s=lambda u: u,
              F=lambda t: sin(gamma*t), dt=2*pi/60,

An appropriate program is

For $\beta = 0.2$ we see that the amplitude is not far from unity:

For $\beta =0.05$ we see that as $\gamma\rightarrow 1$, the amplitude grows:

FIGURE: [fig-vib/resonance2, width=800 frac=1]

Finally, a small damping ($\beta = 0.005$) amplifies the amplitude significantly (by a factor of 10) for $\gamma=1$:

FIGURE: [fig-vib/resonance1, width=800 frac=1]

For a very small $\beta=0.00005$, the amplitude grows linearly up to
about 60 for $\bar t\in [0,120]$.

We simulate for an almost linear spring in the regime of $\bar u$ (recall
that $\bar u\in [0,1]$ since $u$ is scaled with $I$), which corresponds
to $\alpha = 1$ in a) and therefore $\gamma =1$. Then we can try a
spring whose force quickly flattens out like $\alpha=5$ in a), which
corresponds to $\gamma = 5$ in the scaled model. A third option is
to have a truly linear spring, e.g., $\gamma =0.1$. After some
experimentation we realize that $\beta=0,0.05, 0.1$ are relevant values.

Section ref{vib:app:bouncing_ball} presents a model for a bouncing
ball.
Choose one of the two ODE formulation, (ref{vib:app:bouncing:ball:h2eq}) or
(ref{vib:app:bouncing:ball:veq})-(ref{vib:app:bouncing:ball:heq}),

A naive implementation may get stuck in repeated impacts for large time
step sizes. To avoid this situation, one can introduce a state
variable that holds the mode of the motion: free fall, impact, or rest.
Two consecutive impacts imply that the motion has stopped.

===== Exercise: Simulate a simple pendulum  =====
label{vib:exer:pendulum_simple}
file=simple_pendulum

Simulation of simple pendulum can be carried out by using
the mathematical model derived in Section ref{vib:app:pendulum}
and calling up functionality in the "`vib.py`": "${src_vib}/vib.py"
file (i.e., solve the second-order ODE by centered finite differences).

!bsubex
Scale the model. Set up the dimensionless governing equation for $\theta$
and expressions for dimensionless drag and wire forces.

!bsol
The angle is measured in radians so we may think of this quantity as
dimensionless, or we may scale it by the initial condition to obtain
a primary unknown that lies in $[-1,1]$. We go for the former strategy here.

Dimensionless time $\bar t$ is introduced as $t/t_c$ for some suitable
time scale $t_c$.
#We may also introduce a force scale, called $F_c$, for scaling the forces.
Inserted in the two governing equations
(ref{vib:app:pendulum:thetaeq}) and (ref{vib:app:pendulum:ir}),
for the
two unknowns $\theta$ and $S$, respectively, we achieve

!bt
\begin{align*}
-S + mg\cos\theta &= -\frac{1}{t_c}L\frac{d\theta}{d\bar t},\\
\frac{1}{t_c^2}m\frac{d^2\theta}{d\bar t^2} +
\frac{1}{2}C_D\varrho AL \frac{1}{t_c^2}\left\vert
\frac{d\theta}{d\bar t}\right\vert
\frac{d\theta}{d\bar t}
+ \frac{mg}{L}\sin\theta &= 0\tp
\end{align*}
!et
We multiply the latter equation by $t_c^2/m$ to make each term
dimensionless:

!bt
\[ \frac{d^2\theta}{d\bar t^2} +
\frac{1}{2m}C_D\varrho AL \left\vert
\frac{d\theta}{d\bar t}\right\vert
\frac{d\theta}{d\bar t}
+ \frac{t_c^2g}{L}\sin\theta = 0\tp\]
!et
Assuming that the acceleration term and the
gravity term to be the dominating terms, these should balance, so
$t_c^2g/L=1$, giving $t_c = \sqrt{g/L}$. With $A=\pi R^2$ we get the
dimensionless ODEs

!bt
\begin{align}
\frac{d^2\theta}{d\bar t^2} +
\alpha\left\vert\frac{d\theta}{d\bar t}\right\vert\frac{d\theta}{d\bar t} +
\sin\theta &= 0,
label{vib:exer:pendulum_simple:eq:ith:s}\\
\frac{S}{mg} &= \left(\frac{d\theta}{d\bar t}\right)^2 + \cos\theta,
label{vib:exer:pendulum_simple:eq:ir:s}
\end{align}
!et
where $\alpha$ is a dimensionless drag coefficient

!bt
\[ \alpha = \frac{C_D\varrho\pi R^2L}{2m}\tp\]
!et
Note that in (ref{vib:exer:pendulum_simple:eq:ir:s}) we have divided by
$mg$, which is in fact a force scale, making the gravity force unity
and also $S/mg=1$ in the equilibrium position $\theta=0$. We may
introduce

!bt
\[ \bar S = S/mg\]
!et
as a dimensionless drag force.

The parameter $\alpha$ is about
the ratio of the drag force and the gravity force:

!bt
\[ \frac{|\half C_D\varrho \pi R^2 |v|v|}{|mg|}\sim
\frac{C_D\varrho \pi R^2 L^2 t_c^{-2}}{mg}
\left|\frac{d\bar\theta}{d\bar t}\right|\frac{d\bar\theta}{d\bar t}
\sim \frac{C_D\varrho \pi R^2 L}{2m}\Theta^2 = \alpha \Theta^2\tp\]
!et
(We have that $\theta(t)/d\Theta$ is in $[-1,1]$, so we expect
since $\Theta^{-1}d\bar\theta/d\bar t$ to be around unity. Here,
$\Theta=\theta(0)$.)

Let us introduce $\omega$ for the dimensionless angular velocity,

!bt
\[ \omega = \frac{d\theta}{d\bar t}\tp\]
!et
When $\theta$ is computed, the dimensionless wire and drag forces
are computed by

!bt
\begin{align*}
\bar S &= \omega^2 + \cos\theta,\\
\bar D &= -\alpha |\omega|\omega\tp
\end{align*}
!et
!esol
!esubex

!bsubex
Write a function for computing
$\theta$ and the dimensionless drag force and the force in the wire,
using the `solver` function in
the `vib.py` file. Plot these three quantities
below each other (in subplots) so the graphs can be compared.
Run two cases, first one in the limit of $\Theta$ small and
no drag, and then a second one with $\Theta=40$ degrees and $\alpha=0.8$.

!bsol
The first step is to realize how to utilize the `solver` function for
our dimensionless model. Introducing `Theta` for $\Theta$, the
arguments to `solver` must be set as

!bc pycod
I = Theta
V = 0
m = 1
b = alpha
s = lambda u: sin(u)
F = lambda t: 0
damping = 'quadratic'
!ec
After computing $\theta$, we need to find $\omega$ by finite differences:

!bt
\[ \omega^n = \frac{\theta^{n+1}-\theta^{n-1}}{2\Delta t},
\ n=1,\ldots,N_t-1,\quad \omega^0=\frac{\theta^1-\theta^0}{\Delta t},
\ \omega^{N_t}=\frac{\theta^{N_t}-\theta^{N_t-1}}{\Delta t}\tp\]
!et
The duration of the simulation and the time step can be computed on
basis of the analytical insight we have for small $\theta$
($\theta\approx \Theta\cos(t)$). A complete function then reads

@@@CODE exer-vib/simple_pendulum.py fromto: def simulate@def visualize

Assuming imports like

!bc pycod

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

the following function visualizes $\theta$, $\bar S$, and $\bar D$
with three subplots:

A suitable main program is

The ``verification'' case looks good (at least when the `solver` function
has been thoroughly verified in other circumstances):

===== Exercise: Simulate an elastic pendulum  =====
label{vib:exer:pendulum_elastic}
file=elastic_pendulum

Section ref{vib:app:pendulum_elastic} describes a model for an elastic
pendulum, resulting in a system of two ODEs. The purpose of this
exercise is to implement the scaled model, test the software, and
generalize the model.

!bsubex
Write a function `simulate`
that can simulate an elastic pendulum using the scaled model.
The function should have the following arguments:

!bc pycod
def simulate(
    beta=0.9,                 # dimensionless parameter
    Theta=30,                 # initial angle in degrees
    epsilon=0,                # initial stretch of wire
    num_periods=6,            # simulate for num_periods
    time_steps_per_period=60, # time step resolution
    plot=True,                # make plots or not
    ):
!ec
To set the total simulation time and the time step, we
use our knowledge of the scaled, classical, non-elastic pendulum:
$u^{\prime\prime} + u = 0$, with solution
$u = \Theta\cos \bar t$.
The period of these oscillations is $P=2\pi$
and the frequency is unity. The time
for simulation is taken as `num_periods` times $P$. The time step
is set as $P$ divided by `time_steps_per_period`.

The `simulate` function should return the arrays of
$x$, $y$, $\theta$, and $t$, where $\theta = \tan^{-1}(x/(1-y))$ is
the angular displacement of the elastic pendulum corresponding to the
position $(x,y)$.

If `plot` is `True`, make a plot of $\bar y(\bar t)$
versus $\bar x(\bar t)$, i.e., the physical motion
of the mass at $(\bar x,\bar y)$. Use the equal aspect ratio on the axis
such that we get a physically correct picture of the motion. Also
make a plot of $\theta(\bar t)$, where $\theta$ is measured in degrees.
If $\Theta < 10$ degrees, add a plot that compares the solutions of
the scaled, classical, non-elastic pendulum and the elastic pendulum
($\theta(t)$).

Although the mathematics here employs a bar over scaled quantities, the
code should feature plain names `x` for $\bar x$, `y` for $\bar y$, and
`t` for $\bar t$ (rather than `x_bar`, etc.). These variable names make
the code easier to read and compare with the mathematics.

!bhint
Equal aspect ratio is set by `plt.gca().set_aspect('equal')` in
Matplotlib (`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`)
and in SciTools by the command
`plt.plot(..., daspect=[1,1,1], daspectmode='equal')`
(provided you have done `import scitools.std as plt`).
!ehint

!bhint
If you want to use Odespy to solve the equations, order the ODEs
like $\dot \bar x, \bar x, \dot\bar y,\bar y$ such that
`odespy.EulerCromer` can be applied.

Here is a suggested `simulate` function:

!bsubex

!esol
!esubex

!bsubex
Write another test function for checking that the pure vertical
motion of the elastic pendulum is correct.
Start with simplifying the ODEs for pure vertical motion and show that
$\bar y(\bar t)$ fulfills a vibration equation with
frequency $\sqrt{\beta/(1-\beta)}$. Set up the exact solution.

Write a test function that
uses this special case to verify the `simulate` function. There will
be numerical approximation errors present in the results from
`simulate` so you have to believe in correct results and set a
(low) tolerance that corresponds to the computed maximum error.
Use a small $\Delta t$ to obtain a small numerical approximation error.

!bsol
For purely vertical motion, the ODEs reduce to $\ddot x = 0$ and

!bt
\[ \frac{d^2\bar y}{d\bar t^2} = -\frac{\beta}{1-\beta}(1-\beta\frac{1}{\sqrt{(\bar y - 1)^2}})(\bar y-1) - \beta = -\frac{\beta}{1-\beta}(\bar y-1 + \beta) - \beta\tp\]
!et
We have here used that $(\bar y -1)/\sqrt{(\bar y -1)^2}=-1$ since
$\bar y$ cannot exceed 1 (the pendulum's wire is fixed at the scaled
point $(0,1)$). In fact, $\bar y$ will be around zero.
(As a consistency check, we realize that in equilibrium, $\ddot\bar y =0$,
and multiplying by $(1-\beta)/\beta$ leads to the expected $\bar y=0$.)
Further calculations easily lead to

!bt
\[ \frac{d^2\bar y}{d\bar t^2} = -\frac{\beta}{1-\beta}\bar y = -\omega^2\bar y,\]
!et
where we have introduced the frequency
$\omega = \sqrt{\beta/(1-\beta)}$.
Solving this standard ODE, with an initial stretching $\bar y(0)=\epsilon$
and no velocity, results in

!bt
\[ \bar y(\bar t) = \epsilon\cos(\omega\bar t)\tp\]
!et

Note that the oscillations we describe here are very different from
the oscillations used to set the period and time step in function
`simulate`. The latter type of oscillations are due to gravity when
a classical, non-elastic pendulum oscillates back and forth, while
$\bar y(\bar t)$ above refers to vertical *elastic* oscillations in the wire
around the equilibrium point in the gravity field. The angular frequency
of the vertical oscillations are given by $\omega$ and the corresponding
period is $\hat P = 2\pi/\omega$. Suppose we want to simulate for
$T=N\hat P = N2\pi/\omega$ and use $n$ time steps per period,
$\Delta\bar t = \hat P/n$. The `simulate` function operates with
a simulation time of `num_periods` times $2\pi$. This means that we must set
`num_periods=N/omega` if we want to simulate to time $T=N\hat P$.
The parameter `time_steps_per_period` must be set to $\omega n$
since `simulate` has $\Delta t$ as $2\pi$ divided by `time_steps_per_period`
and we want $\Delta t = 2\pi\omega^{-1}n^{-1}$.

The corresponding test function can be written as follows.

===== Exercise: Simulate an elastic pendulum with air resistance =====
label{vib:exer:pendulum_elastic_drag}
file=elastic_pendulum_drag

This is a continuation Exercise ref{vib:exer:pendulum_elastic}.
Air resistance on the body with mass $m$ can be modeled by the
force $-\frac{1}{2}\varrho C_D A|\v|\v$,
where $C_D$ is a drag coefficient (0.2 for a sphere), $\varrho$
is the density of air (1.2 $\hbox{kg }\,{\hbox{m}}^{-3}$), $A$ is the
cross section area ($A=\pi R^2$ for a sphere, where $R$ is the radius),
and $\v$ is the velocity of the body.
Include air resistance in the original model, scale the model,
write a function `simulate_drag` that is a copy of the `simulate`
function from Exercise ref{vib:exer:pendulum_elastic}, but with the
new ODEs included, and show plots of how air resistance
influences the motion.

!bsol
We start with the model
(ref{vib:app:pendulum_elastic:x})-(ref{vib:app:pendulum_elastic:vy0}).
Since $\v = \dot x\ii + \dot y\jj$, the air resistance term
can be written

!bt
\[ -q(\dot x\ii + \dot y\jj),\quad q=\frac{1}{2}\varrho C_D A\sqrt{\dot x^2 + \dot y^2}\tp\]
!et
Note that for positive velocities, the pendulum is moving to the right
and the air resistance works against the motion, i.e., in direction of
$-\v = -\dot x\ii - \dot y\jj$.

We can easily include the terms in the ODEs:

!bt
\begin{align}
\ddot x &= -\frac{q}{m}\dot x -\frac{k}{m}\left(1 -\frac{L_0}{L}\right)(x-x_0),
label{vib:app:pendulum_elastic_drag:x}\\
\ddot y &= -\frac{q}{m}\dot y -\frac{k}{m}\left(1 -\frac{L_0}{L}\right)(y-y_0) - g,
label{vib:app:pendulum_elastic_drag:y}\\
L &= \sqrt{(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2},
label{vib:app:pendulum_elastic_drag:L}\\
\end{align}
!et
The initial conditions are not affected.

The next step is to scale the model. We use the same scales as in
Exercise ref{vib:exer:pendulum_elastic}, introduce $\beta$, and $A=\pi R^2$
to simplify the $-q\dot x/m$ term to

!bt
\[ \frac{L_0}{2m}\varrho C_D R^2\beta^{-1}
\sqrt{\left(\frac{d\bar x}{d\bar t}\right)^2 +
\left(\frac{d\bar y}{d\bar t}\right)^2}
= \gamma \beta^{-1}
\sqrt{\left(\frac{d\bar x}{d\bar t}\right)^2 +
\left(\frac{d\bar y}{d\bar t}\right)^2},\]
!et
where $\gamma$ is a second dimensionless parameter:

!bt
\[ \gamma = \frac{L_0}{2m}\varrho C_D R^2\tp\]
!et

The final set of scaled equations is then

!bt
\begin{align}
\frac{d^2\bar x}{d\bar t^2} &= -\gamma\beta^{-1}
\sqrt{\left(\frac{d\bar x}{d\bar t}\right)^2 +
\left(\frac{d\bar y}{d\bar t}\right)^2}\frac{d\bar x}{d\bar t}
-\frac{\beta}{1-\beta}\left(1- \frac{\beta}{\bar L}\right)\bar x,
label{vib:app:pendulum_elastic_drag:x:s}\\
\frac{d^2\bar y}{d\bar t^2} &=
-\gamma\beta^{-1}
\sqrt{\left(\frac{d\bar x}{d\bar t}\right)^2 +
\left(\frac{d\bar y}{d\bar t}\right)^2}\frac{d\bar y}{d\bar t}
-\frac{\beta}{1-\beta}\left(1- \frac{\beta}{\bar L}\right)(\bar y-1)
-\beta,
label{vib:app:pendulum_elastic_drag:y:s}\\
\bar L &= \sqrt{\bar x^2 + (\bar y-1)^2},
label{vib:app:pendulum_elastic_drag:L:s}\\
\bar x(0) &= (1+\epsilon)\sin\Theta,
label{vib:app:pendulum_elastic_drag:x0:s}\\
\frac{d\bar x}{d\bar t}(0) &= 0,
label{vib:app:pendulum_elastic_drag:vx0:s}\\
\bar y(0) &= 1 - (1+\epsilon)\cos\Theta,
label{vib:app:pendulum_elastic_drag:y0:s}\\
\frac{d\bar y}{d\bar t}(0) &= 0,
label{vib:app:pendulum_elastic_drag:vy0:s}

they call `simulate_drag` instead of `simulate`.

!bremarks
Test functions are challenging to construct for the problem with
air resistance. You can reuse the tests from

It is easy to show that $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ go like sine and cosine

We may assume $x=C_x\cos(\omega t)$ and $y=C_y\sin(\omega t)$ for
constants $C_x,$, $C_y$, and $\omega$. Inserted in the equations, we
see that $\omega =1$. The initial conditions determine the other
constants, which we may choose as $C_x=C_y=1$ (the object starts
at $(1,0)$ with a velocity $(0,1)$). The motion is a perfect circle,
which should last forever.

One believes that a planet may orbit a star for billions of years.
We are now interested
in how accurate methods we actually need for such calculations.
A first task is to determine what the time interval of interest is in
scaled units. Take the earth and sun as typical objects and find
the characteristic time used in the scaling of the equations
($t_c = \sqrt{L^3/(mG)}$), where $m$ is the mass of the sun, $L$ is the
distance between the sun and the earth, and $G$ is the gravitational
constant. Find the scaled time interval corresponding to one billion years.

!bsol
According to "Wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_mass",
the mass of the sun is approximately $2\cdot 10^{30}$ kg. This
is 332946 times the mass of the earth, implying that the
dimensionless constant $\alpha \approx 3\cdot 10^{-6}$. With
$G=6.674\cdot 10^{-11}\hbox{ Nm}^2/\hbox{kg}^2$, and the
"sun-earth distance": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit"
as (approximately) 150 million km, we have $t_c \approx 5 028 388$ s.
This is about 58 days, which is the characteristic time, chosen as the
angular frequency of the oscillations. To get the period of one orbit we therefore must multiply by $2\pi$. This gives about 1 year (and demonstrates the
fact mentioned about the scaling: the natural time scale is consistent with
Kepler's law about the period).

Thus, one billion years correspond to 62,715,924,070 time units (dividing
one billion years by $t_c$), which corresponds to about 2000
``time unit years''.

Make solvers based on Odespy for the current problem, using the

so that it is easy to include other solvers later (below, you will

solver, simulate 10000 orbits and print the maximum
position error and CPU time as a function of time step. Note that the
maximum position error does not necessarily occur at the end of the

Are the results as expected?
Explain briefly.

We develop functions for computing errors and plotting results where we

These results are as expected. The Runge-Kutta implementation is much more accurate than Euler-Cromer, but since it requires more computations, more CPU time is needed. For both methods, accuracy and CPU time both increase as

The simulations done previously with the 4th-order Runge-Kutta and
Euler-Cromer are now to be repeated with the PEFRL solver, so the 
code must be extended accordingly. Then run the simulations and comment
on the performance of PEFRL compared to the other two.

With the PEFRL algorithm, we get

E max with dt...: [0.0010452575786173163, 6.5310955829464402e-05,

The accuracy is now dramatically improved compared to 4th-order Runge-Kutta (and Euler-Cromer).
With 1600 steps per orbit, the PEFRL maximum error is just below $3.0e-07$ per cent, while
the corresponding error with Runge-Kutta was about $7.7e-05$ per cent! This is striking, 
considering the fact that the 4th-order Runge-Kutta and the PEFRL schemes are both 4th-order accurate.

Use the PEFRL solver to simulate 100000 orbits with a fixed time step
corresponding to 1600 steps per period. Record the maximum error
within each subsequent group of 1000 orbits. Plot these errors and fit
(least squares) a mathematical function to the data. Print also the
total CPU time spent for all 100000 orbits.

Now, predict the error and required CPU time for a simulation of 1
billion years (orbits).  Is it feasible on today's computers to
simulate the planetary motion for one billion years?

The complete code (which also produces the printouts given previously) reads:

@@@CODE exer-vib/vib_PEFRL.py 

The maximum error develops with number of orbits as seen in the following plot,
where the red dashed curve is from the mathematical model:

FIGURE: [fig-vib/PEFRL_E_with_years, width=600 frac=0.8]

We note that the maximum error achieved during the first 100000 orbits is only 
about $1.2e-06$ per cent. Not bad!

For the printed CPU and empirical formula, we get:
!bc dat
CPU (hours): 1.51591388889
Empirical formula (E with years):   
3.15992325978e-26*x**4 + -6.1772567063e-21*x**3 + 
1.87983349496e-16*x**2 + 2.32924158693e-11*x**1 + 
5.46989368301e-08*x**0
!ec
Since the CPU develops linearly, the CPU time for 100000 orbits can just be multiplied by 10000 to get the
estimated CPU time required for 1 billion years. This gives 15159 CPU hours (631 days), which is also printed.

With the derived empirical formula, the estimated orbit error after 1 billion years becomes 31593055529 per cent.

[sl: Can we really use the plot and the function to predict max E during 1 billion years? Seems hard.]

This exercise investigates whether it is feasible to predict
planetary motion for the life time of a solar system.
[hpl: Is it???]
