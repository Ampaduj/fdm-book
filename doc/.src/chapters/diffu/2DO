- use uxx and uyy as variables in schemes. Vectorized versions can
be coded as in http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.nonlin.html
Do this for wave as well.
- Redo all figures and movies: F is now mesh Fourier number, not C as in fig/mov
- explain the operator splitting concept (not ADI, but a reference to
the relation to ADI) since this concept can be used for reaction-diffusion
equations as well (say zombie modeling).

- Plots of amplification factors have C, not F_o in the title
