======= Random walk =======
label{diffu:randomwalk}

Models leading to diffusion equations, see Section ref{diffu:app},
are based on *averaged* reasoning such that the primary quantities
(concentration, temperature, velocity) have a smooth behavior in
space and time. The underlying phystical processes involve complicated
microscopic movement of atoms and molecules, but an average of a large
number of molecules is thought to be performed in a small volume
before the modeling starts, and the averaged quantity is assigned as
a point value at the centroid of the small volume. This means that
concentration, temperature, and velocity at a space-time point represent
an average around the point in a small time interval and small spatial
volume.

Random walk is a principally totally different kind of modeling procedure.
The idea is to have a large number of ``particles'' that undergo
random movements. Averaging can then be used to compute
macroscopic quantities like concentration. The ``particles'' and their
random movement represent a very simplified microscopic behavior of
molecules, much simpler and computationally much more efficient than
direct "molecular simulation": "",
yet the random walk model has been very powerful to describe a wide
range of phenomena, including heat conduction, quantum mechanics,
polymer chains, population genetics, brain research, hazard games, and
pricing of financial instruments.

It can be shown that random walk, when averaged, produce models that
are mathematically equivalent to diffusion equations. This is the
primary reason why we treat random walk in this chapter: two very
different algorithms (finite difference stencils and random walk)
solve the same type of problems. The simplicity of the random walk
algorithm makes it particularly attractive for solving diffusion
equations on massively parallel computers.

===== Random walk in 1D =====

Imagine that we have some particles that perform random moves, either
to the right or to the left. We may flip a coin to decide the movement
of each particle, say head implies movement to the right and tail
means movement to the left. Each move is one unit length.  Physicists
use the term *random walk* for this type of movement.
You may try this yourself: flip the coin and make one step to the left
or right, and repeat this process.

The movement is also known as "drunkard's walk":
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Drunkard%27s_Walk". You may have
experienced this after a very wet night on a pub: you step forward and
backward in a random fashion.  Since these movements on average make
you stand still, and since you know that you normally reach home
within reasonable time, the model is not good for a real walk. We need
to add a *drift* to the walk, so the probability is greater for going
forward than backward. This is an easy adjustment, see Exercise
ref{sec:random:ex1}. What may come as a surprise is the following
fact: even when there is equal probability of going forward and
backward, one can prove mathematically that the drunkard will always
reach his home. Or more precisely, he will get home in finite time
(``almost surely'' as the mathematicians must add to this statement).
Exercise ref{sec:random:ex3} asks you to experiment with this fact.
For many practical purposes, ``finite time'' does not help much as
there might be more steps involved than the time it takes to get
sufficiently sober to remove the completely random component of the
walk.

===== Playing around with some code =====

Python has a `random` module for drawing random numbers, and a function
`uniform(a, b)` for drawing a uniformly distributed
random number in the interval $[a,b)$.
If an event happens with probability $p$, we can simulate this on
the computer by drawing a random number $r$ in $[0,1)$, since $r\leq p$
with probability $p$ and $r>p$ with probability $1-p$:

!bc pycod
import random
if random.uniform(0, 1) <= p:
    # Event happens
else:
    # Event does not happen
!ec
A random walk with $N$ steps, starting at $x_0$, where we move
to the left with probability $p$ and to the right
with probability $1-p$ can now be implemented by

!bc pypro
import random, numpy as np

def random_walk(x0, N, p):
    position = np.zeros(N)
    position[0] = x0
    for i in range(N-1):
        if random.uniform(0, 1) <= p:
   	    position[i+1] = position[i] - 1  # Move to the left
	else:
   	    position[i+1] = position[i] + 1  # Move to the right
    return numpy.mean(position), numpy.std(position), position
!ec
Here is some interactive experimentation

===== Basic implementation =====

How can we implement $n_s$ random steps of $n_p$ particles in a program?
Let us introduce a coordinate system where all movements are along
the $x$ axis. An array of $x$ values then holds the positions of all
particles. We draw random numbers to simulate flipping a coin, say
we draw from the integers 1 and 2, where 1 means head (movement to the
right) and 2 means tail (movement to the left).
We think the algorithm is conveniently expressed directly as a
complete Python program:

@@@CODE src-random/walk1D.py
This program is found in the file "`walk1D.py`":
"${src_path}/random/walk1D.py".

===== Visualization =====

idx{`time` module}

We may add some visualization of the movements by inserting a `plot`
command at the end of the `step` loop and a little pause to better
separate the frames in the animation:

!bc pycod
    plot(positions, y, 'ko3', axis=[xmin, xmax, -0.2, 0.2])
    time.sleep(0.2)  # pause
!ec
These two statements require `from scitools.std import plot` and
`import time`.

It is very important that the extent of the axis are kept fixed in
animations, otherwise one gets a wrong visual impression.  We know
that in $n_s$ steps, no particle can move longer than $n_s$ unit
lengths to the right or to the left so the extent of the $x$ axis
becomes $[-n_s,n_s]$. However, the probability of reaching these lower
or upper limit is very small.  To be specific, the probability is
$2^{-n_s}$, which becomes about $10^{-9}$ for 30 steps.  Most of the
movements will take place in the center of the plot. We may therefore
shrink the extent of the axis to better view the movements.  It is
known that the expected extent of the particles is of the order
$\sqrt{n_s}$, so we may take the maximum and minimum values in the
plot as $\pm 2\sqrt{n_s}$.  However, if a position of a particle
exceeds these values, we extend `xmax` and `xmin` by
$2\sqrt{n_s}$ in positive and negative $x$ direction, respectively.

The $y$ positions of the particles are taken as zero, but it is
necessary to have some extent of the $y$ axis, otherwise the
coordinate system collapses and most plotting packages will refuse to
draw the plot. Here we have just chosen the $y$ axis to go from -0.2
to 0.2.  You can find the complete program in
"`walk1Dp.py`": "${src_path}/random/walk1Dp.py".  The `np`
and `ns` parameters can be set as the first two command-line
arguments:

!bc sys
walk1Dp.py 6 200
!ec
It is hard to claim that this program has astonishing graphics.
In Section ref{sec:random:rw2D}, where we let the particles move
in two space dimensions, the graphics gets much more exciting.

===== Random walk as a difference equation =====

The random walk process can easily be expressed in terms of a
difference
equation (see refch[Appendix ref{ch:diffeq}][ cite{Langtangen_TCSE6_diffeq}][the document "Sequences and difference equations": "http://hplgit.github.io/primer.html/doc/pub/diffeq" cite{Langtangen_TCSE6_diffeq}] for an introduction
to difference equations).
Let $x_n$ be the
position of the particle at time $n$. This position is an evolution
from time $n-1$, obtained by adding a random variable $s$ to the previous
position $x_{n-1}$, where $s=1$ has probability 1/2 and $s=-1$ has
probability 1/2. In statistics, the expression *probability of event A*
is written $\Prob{A}$. We can therefore write
$\Prob{s=1}=1/2$ and $\Prob{s=-1}=1/2$. The difference equation
can now be expressed mathematically as

!bt
\begin{equation}
x_n = x_{n-1} + s, \quad x_0=0,\quad {\rm P}(s=1)={\rm P}(s=-1)=1/2\tp
label{sec:random:walk:diffeq}
\end{equation}
!et
This equation governs the motion of one particle. For a collection
$m$ of particles we introduce $x^{(i)}_n$ as the position of the
$i$-th particle at the $n$-th time step.
Each $x^{(i)}_n$ is governed by (ref{sec:random:walk:diffeq}),
and all the $s$ values in each of the $m$ difference equations
are independent of each other.

===== Computing statistics of the particle positions =====
label{sec:random:walk:1D:statistics}

Scientists interested in random walks are in general not interested in
the graphics of our `walk1D.py` program, but more in the
statistics of the positions of the particles at each step. We may
therefore, at each step, compute a histogram of the distribution of
the particles along the $x$ axis, plus estimate the mean position and
the standard deviation. These mathematical operations are easily
accomplished by letting the SciTools function
`compute_histogram` and the `numpy`
functions `mean` and `std` operate on the `positions`
array (see Section ref{sec:random:statistics})
:

!bc pycod
    mean_pos  = numpy.mean(positions)
    stdev_pos = numpy.std(positions)
    pos, freq = compute_histogram(positions, nbins=int(xmax),
                                  piecewise_constant=True)
!ec
The number of bins in the histogram is just based on the extent of
the particles. It could also have been a fixed number.

We can plot the particles as circles, as before, and add
the histogram and vertical lines for the mean and the positive and
negative standard deviation (the latter indicates the ``width'' of
the distribution of particles).
The vertical lines can be defined by the six lists

!bc pycod
    xmean, ymean   = [mean_pos, mean_pos],     [yminv, ymaxv]
    xstdv1, ystdv1 = [stdev_pos, stdev_pos],   [yminv, ymaxv]
    xstdv2, ystdv2 = [-stdev_pos, -stdev_pos], [yminv, ymaxv]
!ec
where `yminv` and `ymaxv` are the minimum and maximum
$y$ values of the vertical lines.
The following command plots the position of every particle
as circles, the histogram as a curve,
and the vertical lines with a thicker line:

!bc pycod
    plot(positions, y, 'ko3',     # particles as circles
         pos, freq, 'r',          # histogram
         xmean, ymean, 'r2',      # mean position as thick line
         xstdv1, ystdv1, 'b2',    # +1 standard dev.
         xstdv2, ystdv2, 'b2',    # -1 standard dev.
         axis=[xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax],
         title='random walk of %d particles after %d steps' %
               (np, step+1))
!ec
This plot is then created at every step in the random walk.  By
observing the graphics, one will soon realize that the computation of
the extent of the $y$ axis in the plot needs some considerations. We
have found it convenient to base `ymax` on the maximum value of the
histogram (`max(freq)`), plus some space (chosen as 10 percent of
`max(freq)`).  However, we do not change the `ymax` value unless it is
more than 0.1 different from the previous `ymax` value (otherwise the
axis ``jumps'' too often).  The minimum value, `ymin`, is set to
`ymin=-0.1*ymax` every time we change the `ymax` value.  The complete
code is found in the file "`walk1Ds.py`":
"${src_path}/random/walk1Ds.py".  If you try out 2000 particles and 30
steps, the final graphics becomes like that in Figure
ref{fig:random:walk:1D}.  As the number of steps is increased, the
particles are dispersed in the positive and negative $x$ direction,
and the histogram gets flatter and flatter. Letting $\hat H(i)$ be the
histogram value in interval number $i$, and each interval having width
$\Delta x$, the probability of finding a particle in interval $i$ is
$\hat H(i)\Delta x$.  It can be shown mathematically that the
histogram is an approximation to the probability density function of
the normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation $s\sim
\sqrt{n}$, where $n$ is the step number.

FIGURE: [fig-random/randomwalk1D, width=400 frac=0.8] Particle positions (circles), histogram (piecewise constant curve),   and vertical lines indicating the mean value and the standard deviation   from the mean after a one-dimensional random walk of 2000 particles   for 30 steps. label{fig:random:walk:1D}


===== Vectorized implementation =====
label{sec:random:walk:1D:vectorized}

idx{`randint` (from `numpy.random`)}
idx{`random_integers` (from `numpy.random`)}

There is no problem with the speed of our one-dimensional random walkers
in the `walk1Dp.py` or `walk1Ds.py` programs,
but in real-life applications of such
simulation models, we often have a very large number of particles performing
a very large number of steps. It is then important to make the implementation
as efficient as possible. Two loops over all particles and all steps,
as we have in the programs above, become
very slow compared to a vectorized implementation.

A vectorized implementation of a one-dimensional walk should utilize
the functions `randint`
or `random_integers` from `numpy`'s `random` module. A first idea may be to
draw steps for all particles at a step simultaneously. Then we repeat
this process in a loop from 0 to $n_s-1$. However, these repetitions
are just new vectors of random numbers, and we may avoid the loop
if we draw $n_p\times n_s$ random numbers at once:

!bc pycod
moves = numpy.random.randint(1, 3, size=np*ns)
# or
moves = numpy.random.random_integers(1, 2, size=np*ns)
!ec
The values are now either 1 or 2, but we want $-1$ or $1$.
A simple scaling and translation of the numbers transform the
1 and 2 values to $-1$ and $1$ values:

!bc pycod
moves = 2*moves - 3
!ec
Then we can create a two-dimensional array out of `moves` such
that `moves[i,j]` is the `i`-th step of particle number `j`:

!bc pycod
moves.shape = (ns, np)
!ec

It does not make sense to plot the evolution of the particles and the
histogram in the vectorized version of the code, because the point with
vectorization is to speed up the calculations, and the visualization
takes much more time than drawing random numbers, even in the
`walk1Dp.py` and `walk1Ds.py` programs from
Section ref{sec:random:walk:1D:statistics}. We therefore just
compute the positions of the particles inside a loop over the steps
and some simple statistics. At the end, after $n_s$ steps, we
plot the histogram of the particle distribution along with circles for
the positions of the particles. The rest of the program, found in
the file "`walk1Dv.py`": "${src_path}/random/walk1Dv.py", looks as follows:

!bc pycod
positions = numpy.zeros(np)
for step in range(ns):
    positions += moves[step, :]

    mean_pos = numpy.mean(positions)
    stdev_pos = numpy.std(positions)
    print mean_pos, stdev_pos

nbins = int(3*sqrt(ns))    # no of intervals in histogram
pos, freq = compute_histogram(positions, nbins,
                              piecewise_constant=True)

plot(positions, zeros(np), 'ko3',
     pos, freq, 'r',
     axis=[min(positions), max(positions), -0.01, 1.1*max(freq)],
     savefig='tmp.pdf')
!ec

======= Random walk in two space dimensions =======
label{sec:random:rw2D}

A random walk in two dimensions performs a step either to the north,
south, west, or east, each one with probability $1/4$.
To demonstrate this process,
we introduce $x$ and $y$ coordinates of $n_p$ particles and
draw random numbers among 1, 2, 3, or 4
to determine the move.
The positions of the particles can easily
be visualized as small circles in an $xy$ coordinate system.

===== Basic implementation =====
label{sec:random:rw2D:scalar}

The algorithm described above
is conveniently expressed directly as a complete working program:

@@@CODE src-random/walk2D.py
The program is found in the file "`walk2D.py`":
"${src_path}/random/walk2D.py".  Figure
ref{fig:random:walk:2D:particles} shows two snapshots of the
distribution of 3000 particles after 40 and 400 steps.  These plots
were generated with command-line arguments `3000 400 20`, the latter
implying that we visualize the particles every 20 time steps only.

FIGURE: [fig-random/randomwalk2D, width=400 frac=0.9] Location of 3000 particles starting at the origin and performing a random walk, with 40 steps (left) and 400 steps (right). label{fig:random:walk:2D:particles}

To get a feeling for the two-dimensional random walk you can try out
only 30 particles for 400 steps and let each step be visualized
(i.e., command-line arguments `30 400 1`).
The update of the movements is now fast.

idx{making movie}idx{`convert` program}idx{`animate`}

The `walk2D.py` program dumps the plots to PDF files
with names of the form `tmp_xxx.pdf`, where `xxx` is
the step number. We can create a movie out of these individual
files using the program `convert` from the ImageMagick suite:

!bc sys
Terminal> convert -delay 50 -loop 1000 tmp_*.pdf movie.gif
!ec
All the plots are now put after each other as frames in a movie, with
a delay of 50 ms between each frame. The movie will run in a loop
1000 times.
The resulting movie file is named `movie.gif`, which can
be viewed by the `animate` program (also from the ImageMagick
program suite), just write `animate movie.gif`.
Making and showing the movie are slow processes if a large number of
steps are included in the movie. The alternative is to make
a true video file in, e.g., the Flash format:

!bc sys
Terminal> avconv -r 5 -i tmp_%04d.png -c:v flv movie.flv
!ec
This requires the plot files to be in PNG format.

===== Vectorized implementation =====
label{sec:random:walk:2D:vectorized}

The `walk2D.py` program is quite slow. Now the visualization is much
faster than the movement of the particles.  Vectorization may speed up
the `walk2D.py` program significantly.  As in the one-dimensional
phase, we draw all the movements at once and then invoke a loop over
the steps to update the $x$ and $y$ coordinates.  We draw $n_s\times
n_p$ numbers among 1, 2, 3, and 4.  We then reshape the vector of
random numbers to a two-dimensional array `moves[i, j]`, where `i`
counts the steps, `j` counts the particles.  The `if` test on whether
the current move is to the north, south, east, or west can be
vectorized using the `where`
# #ifdef PRIMER_BOOK function (see
Section ref{sec:vec:Heaviside}).
# #else
function.
# #endif
For example, if the random numbers for all particles in the current step
are accessible in an array `this_move`, we could update the $x$
positions by

!bc pycod
xpositions += np.where(this_move == EAST, 1, 0)
xpositions -= np.where(this_move == WEST, 1, 0)
!ec
provided `EAST` and `WEST` are constants, equal to 3 and 4,
respectively. A similar construction can be used for the $y$ moves.

The complete program is listed below:

@@@CODE src-random/walk2Dv.py
You will easily experience that this program, found in the file
"`walk2Dv.py`": "${src_path}/random/walk2Dc.py", runs significantly
faster than the `walk2D.py` program.
