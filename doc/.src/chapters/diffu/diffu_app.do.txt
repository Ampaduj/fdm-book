and heat conduction (include Robin/cooling).]

===== Diffusion of a substance =====
label{diffu:app:substance}

The first process to be considered is a substance that gets transported
through a fluid at rest by pure diffusion. We consider an arbitrary
volume $V$ of this fluid, containing the substance with concentration
function $c(\x,t)$. Physically, we can think of a
very small volume with centroid $\x$ at time $t$ and assign the ratio
of the volume of the substance and the total volume to $c(\x, t)$.
This means that the mass of the substance in a
small volume $\Delta V$ is approximately
$\varrho c\Delta V$, where $\varrho$ is the density
of the substance. Consequently, the total mass of the substance inside the volume
$V$ is the sum of all $\varrho c\Delta V$, which becomes the
volume integral $\int_V\varrho cdV$.

Let us reason how the mass of the substance changes and thereby derive
a PDE governing the concentration $c$.
Suppose the substance flows out of $V$ with a flux $\q$.
If $\Delta S$ is a small part of the boundary $\partial V$ of $V$,
the volume of the substance flowing out through $dS$ in a small
time interval $\Delta t$ is $\varrho \q\cdot\normalvec \Delta t \Delta S$,
where $\normalvec$ is an outward unit
normal to the boundary $\partial V$, see Figure ref{diffu:app:substance:fig1}.
We realize that only normal component of $\q$ is able to transport mass
in and out of $V$.
The total outflow of the mass of the substance in a small time interval
$\Delta t$ becomes the surface integral

!bt
\[ \int\limits_{\partial V} \varrho\q\cdot\normalvec \Delta t  dS\tp\]
!et
Assuming conservation of mass, this outflow of mass must be balanced by
a loss of mass inside the volume. The increase of mass inside the volume,
during a small time interval $\Delta t$, is

!bt
\[ \int\limits_V \varrho (c(\x,t+\Delta t) - c(\x,t)) dV,\]
!et
assuming $\varrho$ is constant, which is reasonable.

Setting the two contributions equal to each other ensures balance of
mass inside $V$. Dividing by $\Delta t$ gives

!bt
\[ \int\limits_V \varrho \frac{c(\x,t+\Delta t) - c(\x,t)}{\Delta t} dV =
- \int\limits_{\partial V} \varrho\q\cdot\normalvec dS\tp\]
!et
Note the minus sign on the right-hand side: the left-hand side expresses
loss of mass, while the integral on the right-hand side is the gain of
mass.

Now, letting $\Delta t\rightarrow 0$, we have

!bt
\[ \frac{c(\x,t+\Delta t) - c(\x,t)}{\Delta t} \rightarrow
\frac{\partial c}{\partial t},\]
!et
so

!bt
\begin{equation}
\int\limits_V \varrho \frac{\partial c}{\partial t}dV +
\int\limits_{\partial V} \varrho\q\cdot\normalvec dS = 0\tp
label{diffu:app:substance:integral}
\end{equation}
!et
To arrive at a PDE,
we express the surface integral as a volume integral using Gauss'
divergence theorem:

!bt
\[
\int\limits_V (\varrho \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} +
\nabla\cdot(\varrho q))dV = 0\tp
\]
!et
Since $\varrho$ is constant, we can divide by this quantity.
If the integral is to vanish for an arbitrary volume $V$,
the integrand must vanish too,
and we get the mass conservation PDE for the substance:

!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial c}{\partial t} +
\nabla\cdot q = 0\tp
label{diffu:app:substance:massconv}
\end{equation}
!et

A fundamental problem is that this is a scalar PDE for four unknowns:
$c$ and the three components of $\q$. We therefore need additional
equations. Here, Fick's law comes at rescue: it models how the flux $\q$
of the substance is related to the concentration $c$. Diffusion is
recognized by mass flowing from regions with high concentration to regions
of low concentration. This principle suggests that $\q$ is proportional
to the negative gradient of $c$:

!bt
\begin{equation}
\q = -\dfc\nabla c,
label{diffu:app:substance:Fick}
\end{equation}
!et
where $\dfc$ is an empirically determined constant.
The relation (ref{diffu:app:substance:Fick}) is known as Fick's law.
Inserting (ref{diffu:app:substance:Fick}) in
(ref{diffu:app:substance:massconv}) gives a scalar PDE for the
concentration $c$:

!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = \dfc\nabla^2 c\tp
label{diffu:app:substance:PDE}
\end{equation}
!et

===== Heat conduction =====
label{diffu:app:heat}

Heat conduction is a well-known diffusion process. The governing PDE
is in this case based on the first law of thermodynamics: the increase
in energy of a system is equal to the work done on the system, plus the
supplied heat. Here, we shall media at rest and neglect the work done
on the system. The principle then reduces to a balance between
increase in internal energy and the supplied heat flow by conduction.

Let $e(x,t)$ be the *internal energy* per unit mass. The increase of
the internal energy in a small volume $\Delta V$ in a small time
interval $\Delta t$ is then

!bt
\[ \varrho (e(\x,t+\Delta t) - e(\x,t))\Delta V,\]
!et
where $\varrho$ is the density of the material subject to heat conduction.
In an arbitrary volume $V$, as depicted in
Figure ref{diffu:app:substance:fig1}, the corresponding increase in internal
energy becomes the volume integral

!bt
\[ \int\limits_V \varrho (e(\x,t+\Delta t) - e(\x,t))dV\tp\]
!et
This increase in internal energy is balanced by heat supplied by
conduction. Let $\q$ be the heat flow per time unit. Through the
surface $\partial V$ of $V$ the following amount of heat flows out
of $V$ during a time interval $\Delta t$:

!bt
\[
\int\limits_{\partial V} \q\cdot\normalvec\Delta t dS\tp\]
!et
The simplified version of the first law of thermodynamics then states that

!bt
\[
\int\limits_V \varrho (e(\x,t+\Delta t) - e(\x,t))dV = -
\int\limits_{\partial V} \q\cdot\normalvec\Delta t dS\tp
\]
!et
The minus sign on the right-hand side ensures that the integral there
models net *inflow* of heat (since $\normalvec$ is an outward unit normal,
$\q\cdot\normalvec$ models *outflow*).
Dividing by $\Delta t$ and notifying that

!bt
\[ \lim_{\Delta t\rightarrow 0}
\frac{e(\x,t+\Delta t) - e(\x,t)}{\Delta t} =
\frac{\partial e}{\partial t},\]
!et
we get (in the limit $\Delta t\rightarrow 0$)

!bt
\[
\int\limits_V \varrho \frac{\partial e}{\partial t} dV +
\int\limits_{\partial V} \q\cdot\normalvec\Delta t dS = 0\tp
\]
!et
This is the integral equation for heat conduction, but we aim at a PDE.
The next step is therefore to transform the surface integral to a
volume integral via Gauss' divergence theorem. The result is

!bt
\[
\int\limits_V\left( \varrho \frac{\partial e}{\partial t}
+ \nabla\cdot\q\right) dV = 0\tp
\]
!et
If this equality is to hold for all volumes $V$, the integrand must vanish,
and we have the PDE

!bt
\begin{equation}
\varrho \frac{\partial e}{\partial t} = -\nabla\cdot\q\tp
label{diffu:app:heat:PDE1}
\end{equation}
!et

Sometimes the supplied heat can come from the medium itself. This is
the case, for instance, when radioactive rock generates heat.
Let us add this effect. If $f(\x,t)$ is the supplied heat
per unit volume per unit time, the heat supplied in a small volume
is $f\Delta t\Delta V$, and inside an arbitrary volume $V$ the
supplied generated heat becomes

!bt
\[ \int\limits_V f\Delta t dV\tp\]
!et
Adding this to the integral statement reflecting the first law of
thermodynamics and continuing the derivation leads to the PDE

!bt
\begin{equation}
\varrho \frac{\partial e}{\partial t} = -\nabla\cdot\q + f\tp
label{diffu:app:heat:PDE2}
\end{equation}
!et

There are four unknown scalar fields: $e$ and $\q$. Moreover, the
temperature $T$, which is our primary quantity to compute, does not
enter the model yet. We need an additional equation, called the
*equation of state*, relating $e$, $V=1/\varrho=$, and $T$:
$e=e(V,T)$. By the chain rule we have

!bt
\[ \frac{\partial e}{\partial t} =
\left.\frac{\partial e}{\partial T}\right\vert_{V}
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} +
\left.\frac{\partial e}{\partial V}\right\vert_{T}
\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}\tp\]
!et
The first coefficient $\partial e/\partial T$ is called *specific heat
capacity at constant volume*, denoted by $c_v$:

!bt
\[ c_v = \left.\frac{\partial e}{\partial T}\right\vert_{V}\tp\]
!et
The specific heat capacity will in general vary with $T$, but taking it as a
constant is a good approximation in many applications.

The term $\partial e/\partial V$ models effects due to compressibility
and volume expansion. These effects are often small and can be neglected.
We shall do so here. Using $\partial e/\partial t = c_v\partial T/\partial t$
in the PDE gives

!bt
\[ \varrho c_v\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = -\nabla\cdot\q + f\tp\]
!et
We still have four unknown scalar fields ($T$ and $\q$). To close the
system, we need a relation between the heat flux $\q$ and the temperature $T$
called Fourier's law:

!bt
\[ \q = -\dfc\nabla T,\]
!et
which simply states that heat flows from cold to hot areas, along the
path of greatest variation. In a solid medium, $\alpha$ depends on the
material of the medium, and in multi-material media one must regard
$\dfc$ as spatially dependent. In a fluid, it is common to assume that
$\dfc$ is a constant. The value of $\dfc$ reflects how easy heat is
conducted through the medium, and $\dfc$ is named the *coefficient of
heat conduction*.

We have now one scalar PDE for the unknown temperature field $T(\x,t)$:

!bt
\begin{equation}
\varrho  c_v\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \nabla\cdot(\dfc\nabla T) + f\tp
label{diffu:app:heat:PDE}
\end{equation}
!et


===== Development of flow between two flat plates =====

Diffusion equations may also arise as simplified versions of other
mathematical models, especially in fluid flow. Consider a fluid flowing
between two flat, parallel plates. The velocity is uni-directional, say
along the $z$ axis, and depends
only on the distance $x$ from the plates; $\u = u(x,t)\kk$.
The flow is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations,

!bt
\begin{align*}
\varrho\frac{\partial\u}{\partial t} + \varrho\u\cdot\nabla\u &= -\nabla p
+ \mu\nabla^2\u + \varrho\f,\\
\nabla\cdot\u &= 0,
\end{align*}
!et
where $p$ is the pressure field, unknown along with the velocity $\u$,
$\varrho$ is the fluid density, $\mu$ the dynamic viscosity, and $\f$
is some external body force. The geometric restrictions of flow between
two flat plates puts restrictions on the velocity, $\u = u(x,t)\ii$,
and the $z$ component of the Navier-Stokes equations collapses to
a diffusion equation:

!bt
\[
\varrho\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = - \frac{\partial p}{\partial z}
\mu\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2}
+ \varrho f_z,
\]
!et
if $f_z$ is the component of $\f$ in the $z$ direction.

The boundary conditions are derived from the fact that the fluid sticks to
the plates, which means $\u=0$ at the plates. Say the location of the
plates are $z=0$ and $z=L$, we have

!bt
\[ u(0,t)=u(L,t)=0\tp\]
!et

One can easily show that $\partial p/\partial z$ must be a constant or
just a function of time $t$. We set $\partial p/\partial z = -\beta$.
The body force could be a component of gravity, if desired, set as
$f_z = \gamma g$. Switching from $z$ to $x$ as independent variable gives
a very standard one-dimensional diffusion equation:

!bt
\[
\varrho\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} =
\mu\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2} + beta + \varrho\gamma g,\quad
x\in [0,L],\ t\in (0,T]\tp
\]
!et
The boundary conditions are

!bt
\[ u(0,t)=u(L,t)=0,\]
!et
while some initial condition

!bt
\[ u(x,0) = I(x)\]
!et
must also be prescribed.

The flow is driven by either the pressure gradient $\beta$ or gravity, or
a combination of both. One may also consider one moving plate that
drives the fluid. If the plate at $x=L$ moves with velocity $U_L(t)$, we have
the adjusted boundary condition

!bt
\[ u(L,t) = U_L(t)\tp\]
!et

One can make a model of how electrical signals are propagated along the
neuronal fibers that receive synaptic inputs in the brain. The signal
propagation is one-dimensional and can is the simplest cases be
governed by the "Cable equation": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_equation":

!bt
\begin{equation}
c_m \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} =
\frac{1}{r_l}\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial x^2} - \frac{1}{r_m}V
label{}
\end{equation}
!et
where $V(x,t)$ is the voltage to be determined,
$c_m$ is capacitance of the neuronal fiber, while
$r_l$ and $r_m$ are measures of the resistance.
The boundary conditions of often taken as $V=0$ at a short circuit or open end,
$\partial V/\partial x=0$ at a sealed end, or $\partial V/\partial x \propto
V$ where there is an injection of current.
