===== Development of flow between two plates =====

Think of thin films, locally this is plane Couette flow.

Solution, $y=0$ moves with $U_0$, $y=H$ is fixed:

!bt
\begin{equation}
u = U_0\left( 1 - \frac{y}{H} - \frac{2}{pi}\sum_{i=1}^\infty
\frac{1}{i}\exp{\left(-i\pi\nu t/H^2\right)}\sin{\left(\frac{i\pi y}{H}\right)}
\right)
\end{equation}
!et
Change variable $y\rightarrow H-y$, so that $y=H$ moves, should
be something like

!bt
\[
u = U_0\left( \frac{y}{H} + \frac{2}{pi}\sum_{i=1}^\infty
\frac{1}{i}\exp{\left(-i\pi\nu t/H^2\right)}\sin{\left(\frac{i\pi y}{H}\right)}
\right)
\]
!et
Can just program it and check - or use sin of a sum formula.

One can make a model of how electrical signals are propagated along the
neuronal fibers that receive synaptic inputs in the brain. The signal
propagation is one-dimensional and can is the simplest cases be
governed by the "Cable equation": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_equation":

!bt
\begin{equation}
c_m \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} =
\frac{1}{r_l}\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial x^2} - \frac{1}{r_m}Vm
label{}
\end{equation}
!et
where $V(x,t)$ is the voltage to be determined,
$c_m$ is capacitance of the neuronal fiber, while
$r_l$ and $r_m$ are measures of the resistance.
The boundary conditions of often taken as $V=0$ at a short circuit or open end,
$\partial V/\partial x=0$ at a sealed end, or $\partial V/\partial x \propto
V$ where there is an injection of current.

===== Radial heat conduction out of offshore pipelines =====

# Easy to make something out of the ideas/5620/apps/offshore... mekit
# paper where one has a multi-walled radial heat conduction equation.
# Can, as in the paper, use one cell per material. Coupling to soil
# outside with many parameters given. The discussion of the Fourier
# number is interesting - I guess time changes here relates to
# BCs on the inner wall because the gas suddenly has a different
# temperature? Could be a good project perhaps; anyway, the theory
# can be written up.
