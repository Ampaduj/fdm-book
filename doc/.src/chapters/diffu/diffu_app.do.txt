and heat conduction (include Robin/cooling).]

===== Diffusion of a substance =====
label{diffu:app:substance}

The first process to be considered is a substance that gets
transported through a fluid at rest by pure diffusion. We consider an
arbitrary volume $V$ of this fluid, containing the substance with
concentration function $c(\x,t)$. Physically, we can think of a very
small volume with centroid $\x$ at time $t$ and assign the ratio of
the volume of the substance and the total volume to $c(\x, t)$.  This
means that the mass of the substance in a small volume $\Delta V$ is
approximately $\varrho c\Delta V$, where $\varrho$ is the density of
the substance. Consequently, the total mass of the substance inside
the volume $V$ is the sum of all $\varrho c\Delta V$, which becomes
the volume integral $\int_V\varrho cdV$.

Let us reason how the mass of the substance changes and thereby derive
a PDE governing the concentration $c$.  Suppose the substance flows
out of $V$ with a flux $\q$.  If $\Delta S$ is a small part of the
boundary $\partial V$ of $V$, the volume of the substance flowing out
through $dS$ in a small time interval $\Delta t$ is $\varrho
\q\cdot\normalvec \Delta t \Delta S$, where $\normalvec$ is an outward
unit normal to the boundary $\partial V$, see Figure
ref{diffu:app:substance:fig1}.  We realize that only the normal
component of $\q$ is able to transport mass in and out of $V$.  The
total outflow of the mass of the substance in a small time interval
$\Delta t$ becomes the surface integral

!bt
\[ \int\limits_{\partial V} \varrho\q\cdot\normalvec \Delta t\,  dS\tp\]
!et
Assuming conservation of mass, this outflow of mass must be balanced by
a loss of mass inside the volume. The increase of mass inside the volume,
during a small time interval $\Delta t$, is

!bt
\[ \int\limits_V \varrho (c(\x,t+\Delta t) - c(\x,t)) dV,\]
!et
assuming $\varrho$ is constant, which is reasonable.

Setting the two contributions equal to each other ensures balance of
mass inside $V$. Dividing by $\Delta t$ gives

!bt
\[ \int\limits_V \varrho \frac{c(\x,t+\Delta t) - c(\x,t)}{\Delta t} dV =
- \int\limits_{\partial V} \varrho\q\cdot\normalvec\, dS\tp\]
!et
Note the minus sign on the right-hand side: the left-hand side expresses
loss of mass, while the integral on the right-hand side is the gain of
mass.

Now, letting $\Delta t\rightarrow 0$, we have

!bt
\[ \frac{c(\x,t+\Delta t) - c(\x,t)}{\Delta t} \rightarrow
\frac{\partial c}{\partial t},\]
!et
so

!bt
\begin{equation}
\int\limits_V \varrho \frac{\partial c}{\partial t}dV +
\int\limits_{\partial V} \varrho\q\cdot\normalvec\, dS = 0\tp
label{diffu:app:substance:integral}
\end{equation}
!et
To arrive at a PDE,
we express the surface integral as a volume integral using Gauss'
divergence theorem:

!bt
\[
\int\limits_V (\varrho \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} +
\nabla\cdot(\varrho \q))dV = 0\tp
\]
!et
Since $\varrho$ is constant, we can divide by this quantity.  If the
integral is to vanish for an arbitrary volume $V$, the integrand must
vanish too, and we get the mass conservation PDE for the substance:

!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial c}{\partial t} +
\nabla\cdot \q = 0\tp
label{diffu:app:substance:massconv}
\end{equation}
!et

FIGURE: [fig-diffu/continuum, width=200 frac=0.3] An arbitrary volume of a fluid. label{diffu:app:substance:fig1}

A fundamental problem is that this is a scalar PDE for four unknowns:
$c$ and the three components of $\q$. We therefore need additional
equations. Here, Fick's law comes at rescue: it models how the flux
$\q$ of the substance is related to the concentration $c$. Diffusion
is recognized by mass flowing from regions with high concentration to
regions of low concentration. This principle suggests that $\q$ is
proportional to the negative gradient of $c$:

!bt
\begin{equation}
\q = -\dfc\nabla c,
label{diffu:app:substance:Fick}
\end{equation}
!et
where $\dfc$ is an empirically determined constant.
The relation (ref{diffu:app:substance:Fick}) is known as Fick's law.
Inserting (ref{diffu:app:substance:Fick}) in
(ref{diffu:app:substance:massconv}) gives a scalar PDE for the
concentration $c$:

!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = \dfc\nabla^2 c\tp
label{diffu:app:substance:PDE}
\end{equation}
!et

===== Heat conduction =====
label{diffu:app:heat}

Heat conduction is a well-known diffusion process. The governing PDE
is in this case based on the first law of thermodynamics: the increase
in energy of a system is equal to the work done on the system, plus
the supplied heat. Here, we shall media at rest and neglect the work
done on the system. The principle then reduces to a balance between
increase in internal energy and the supplied heat flow by conduction.

Let $e(x,t)$ be the *internal energy* per unit mass. The increase of
the internal energy in a small volume $\Delta V$ in a small time
interval $\Delta t$ is then

!bt
\[ \varrho (e(\x,t+\Delta t) - e(\x,t))\Delta V,\]
!et
where $\varrho$ is the density of the material subject to heat conduction.
In an arbitrary volume $V$, as depicted in
Figure ref{diffu:app:substance:fig1}, the corresponding increase in internal
energy becomes the volume integral

!bt
\[ \int\limits_V \varrho (e(\x,t+\Delta t) - e(\x,t))dV\tp\]
!et
This increase in internal energy is balanced by heat supplied by
conduction. Let $\q$ be the heat flow per time unit. Through the
surface $\partial V$ of $V$ the following amount of heat flows out
of $V$ during a time interval $\Delta t$:

!bt
\[
\int\limits_{\partial V} \q\cdot\normalvec\Delta t\, dS\tp\]
!et
The simplified version of the first law of thermodynamics then states that

!bt
\[
\int\limits_V \varrho (e(\x,t+\Delta t) - e(\x,t))dV = -
\int\limits_{\partial V} \q\cdot\normalvec\Delta t\, dS\tp
\]
!et
The minus sign on the right-hand side ensures that the integral there
models net *inflow* of heat (since $\normalvec$ is an outward unit normal,
$\q\cdot\normalvec$ models *outflow*).
Dividing by $\Delta t$ and notifying that

!bt
\[ \lim_{\Delta t\rightarrow 0}
\frac{e(\x,t+\Delta t) - e(\x,t)}{\Delta t} =
\frac{\partial e}{\partial t},\]
!et
we get (in the limit $\Delta t\rightarrow 0$)

!bt
\[
\int\limits_V \varrho \frac{\partial e}{\partial t} dV +
\int\limits_{\partial V} \q\cdot\normalvec\Delta t\, dS = 0\tp
\]
!et
This is the integral equation for heat conduction, but we aim at a PDE.
The next step is therefore to transform the surface integral to a
volume integral via Gauss' divergence theorem. The result is

!bt
\[
\int\limits_V\left( \varrho \frac{\partial e}{\partial t}
+ \nabla\cdot\q\right) dV = 0\tp
\]
!et
If this equality is to hold for all volumes $V$, the integrand must vanish,
and we have the PDE

!bt
\begin{equation}
\varrho \frac{\partial e}{\partial t} = -\nabla\cdot\q\tp
label{diffu:app:heat:PDE1}
\end{equation}
!et

Sometimes the supplied heat can come from the medium itself. This is
the case, for instance, when radioactive rock generates heat.  Let us
add this effect. If $f(\x,t)$ is the supplied heat per unit volume per
unit time, the heat supplied in a small volume is $f\Delta t\Delta V$,
and inside an arbitrary volume $V$ the supplied generated heat becomes

!bt
\[ \int\limits_V f\Delta t dV\tp\]
!et
Adding this to the integral statement of the (simplified) first law of
thermodynamics, and continuing the derivation, leads to the PDE

!bt
\begin{equation}
\varrho \frac{\partial e}{\partial t} = -\nabla\cdot\q + f\tp
label{diffu:app:heat:PDE2}
\end{equation}
!et

There are four unknown scalar fields: $e$ and $\q$. Moreover, the
temperature $T$, which is our primary quantity to compute, does not
enter the model yet. We need an additional equation, called the
*equation of state*, relating $e$, $V=1/\varrho=$, and $T$:
$e=e(V,T)$. By the chain rule we have

!bt
\[ \frac{\partial e}{\partial t} =
\left.\frac{\partial e}{\partial T}\right\vert_{V}
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} +
\left.\frac{\partial e}{\partial V}\right\vert_{T}
\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}\tp\]
!et
The first coefficient $\partial e/\partial T$ is called *specific heat
capacity at constant volume*, denoted by $c_v$:

!bt
\[ c_v = \left.\frac{\partial e}{\partial T}\right\vert_{V}\tp\]
!et
The specific heat capacity will in general vary with $T$, but taking it as a
constant is a good approximation in many applications.

The term $\partial e/\partial V$ models effects due to compressibility
and volume expansion. These effects are often small and can be
neglected.  We shall do so here. Using $\partial e/\partial t =
c_v\partial T/\partial t$ in the PDE gives

!bt
\[ \varrho c_v\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = -\nabla\cdot\q + f\tp\]
!et
We still have four unknown scalar fields ($T$ and $\q$). To close the
system, we need a relation between the heat flux $\q$ and the temperature $T$
called Fourier's law:

!bt
\[ \q = -k\nabla T,\]
!et
which simply states that heat flows from hot to cold areas, along the
path of greatest variation. In a solid medium, $k$ depends on the
material of the medium, and in multi-material media one must regard
$k$ as spatially dependent. In a fluid, it is common to assume that
$k$ is a constant. The value of $k$ reflects how easy heat is
conducted through the medium, and $k$ is named the *coefficient of
heat conduction*.

We have now one scalar PDE for the unknown temperature field $T(\x,t)$:

!bt
\begin{equation}
\varrho  c_v\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \nabla\cdot(k\nabla T) + f\tp
label{diffu:app:heat:PDE}
\end{equation}
!et

===== Porous media flow =====
label{diffu:app:porous}

The requirement of mass balance for
flow of a single, incompressible fluid through a deformable (elastic) porous
medium leads to the equation

!bt
\[
S\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \nabla
\cdot(\q - \alpha\frac{\partial\u}{\partial t}) = 0,
\]
!et
where $p$ is the fluid pressure, $\q$ is the fluid velocity, $\u$
is the displacement (deformation) of the medium, $S$ is the storage
coefficient of the medium (related to the compressibilty of the
fluid and the material in the medium), and $\alpha$ is another coefficient.
In many circumstances, the last term with $\u$ can be neglected,
an assumption that decouples the equation above from a model for
the deformation of the medium. The famous Darcy's law relates
$\q$ to $p$:

!bt
\[ \q = -\frac{K}{mu}(\nabla p - \varrho\g),\]
!et
where $K$ is the permeability of the medium, $\mu$ is the dynamic
viscosity of the fluid, $\varrho$ is the density of the fluid, and $\g$
is the acceleration of gravity, here taken as $\g = -g\kk$.
Combining the two equations results in the diffusion model

!bt
\begin{equation}
S\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} = \mu^{-1}\nabla(K\nabla p) + \frac{\varrho g}{\mu}{\frac{\partial K}{\partial z}\tp
label{diffu:app:porous:PDE}
\end{equation}
!et
Boundary conditions consist of specifying $p$ or $\q\cdot\n$ at
(normal velocity) each point of the boundary.

===== Potential fluid flow =====

Let $\v$ be the velocity of a fluid. The condition $\nabla\times\v =0$
is relevant for many flows, especially in geophysics when viscous effects
are negligible. From vector calculus it is known
that $\nabla\times\v 0$ imples that $v$ can be derived
from a scalar potential field $\phi$: $\v = \nabla\phi$. If the
fluid is incompressible, $\nabla\cdot\v = 0$, it follows that
$\nabla\cdot\nabla\phi = 0$, or

!bt
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2\phi = 0\tp
\end{equation}
!et
This Laplace equation is sufficient for determining $\phi$ and thereby
describe the fluid motion. This type of flow is known as
"potential flow": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_flow".
One very important application where potential flow is a good model
is water waves.
As boundary condition we must prescribe
$\v\cdot\normalvec =\partial\phi/\partial n$.

===== Streamlines for 2D fluid flow =====

The streamlines in a two-dimensional
stationary fluid flow are lines tangential to the flow.
The "stream function": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_function"
$\psi$ is often introduced in two-dimensional
such that its contour
lines, $\psi = \hbox{const}$, gives the streamlines. The relation
between $\psi$ and the velocity field $\v=(u,v)$ is

!bt
\[ u = \frac{\partial\psi}{\partial y},\quad v = -
\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}\tp\]
!et
It follows that $\nabla\v = \psi_{yx} - \psi{xy}=0$, so the stream function
can be only be used for incompressible flows.
Since $

!bt
\[\nabla\times\v = \left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right)\kk \equiv \omega\kk,\]
!et
we can derive the relation

!bt
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2\psi = -\omega,
\end{equation}
!et
which is a governing equation for the stream function $\psi(x,y)$
if the vorticity $\omega$ is known.

===== The potential of an electric field =====

Under the assumption of time independence, Maxwell's equations
for the electric field $\bm{E}$ becomes

!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot\bm{E} &= \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0},\\
\nabla\times\bm{E} &= 0,
\end{align*}
!et
where $\rho$ is the electric charge density and $\epsilon_0$ is
the permittivity of free space.
Since $\nabla\times\bm{E}=0$, $\bm{E}$ can be derived from a potential
$\varphi$, $\bm{E} = \nabla\varphi$. The electric field potential is
therefore governed by the Poisson equation

!bt
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2\varrphi = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}\tp
\end{equation}
!et

[hpl: What are appropriate boundary conditions?]
[hpl: Svein, can you get this generalized to electric field inside
some heterogeneous medium? Think we get some variable coefficient
equation in that case (anisotropic conduction?). Can you figure it out?]


===== Development of flow between two flat plates =====
label{diffu:app:Couette}

Diffusion equations may also arise as simplified versions of other
mathematical models, especially in fluid flow. Consider a fluid
flowing between two flat, parallel plates. The velocity is
uni-directional, say along the $z$ axis, and depends only on the
distance $x$ from the plates; $\u = u(x,t)\kk$.  The flow is governed
by the Navier-Stokes equations,

!bt
\begin{align*}
\varrho\frac{\partial\u}{\partial t} + \varrho\u\cdot\nabla\u &= -\nabla p
+ \mu\nabla^2\u + \varrho\f,\\
\nabla\cdot\u &= 0,
\end{align*}
!et
where $p$ is the pressure field, unknown along with the velocity $\u$,
$\varrho$ is the fluid density, $\mu$ the dynamic viscosity, and $\f$
is some external body force. The geometric restrictions of flow between
two flat plates puts restrictions on the velocity, $\u = u(x,t)\ii$,
and the $z$ component of the Navier-Stokes equations collapses to
a diffusion equation:

!bt
\[
\varrho\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = - \frac{\partial p}{\partial z} +
\mu\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2}
+ \varrho f_z,
\]
!et
if $f_z$ is the component of $\f$ in the $z$ direction.

The boundary conditions are derived from the fact that the fluid sticks to
the plates, which means $\u=0$ at the plates. Say the location of the
plates are $z=0$ and $z=L$. We then have

!bt
\[ u(0,t)=u(L,t)=0\tp\]
!et

One can easily show that $\partial p/\partial z$ must be a constant or
just a function of time $t$. We set $\partial p/\partial z = -\beta(t)$.
The body force could be a component of gravity, if desired, set as
$f_z = \gamma g$. Switching from $z$ to $x$ as independent variable gives
a very standard one-dimensional diffusion equation:

!bt
\[
\varrho\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} =
\mu\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2} + \beta(t) + \varrho\gamma g,\quad
x\in [0,L],\ t\in (0,T]\tp
\]
!et
The boundary conditions are

!bt
\[ u(0,t)=u(L,t)=0,\]
!et
while some initial condition

!bt
\[ u(x,0) = I(x)\]
!et
must also be prescribed.

The flow is driven by either the pressure gradient $\beta$ or gravity, or
a combination of both. One may also consider one moving plate that
drives the fluid. If the plate at $x=L$ moves with velocity $U_L(t)$, we have
the adjusted boundary condition

!bt
\[ u(L,t) = U_L(t)\tp\]
!et

[hpl: Exercises based on this diffusion model.]

===== Flow in a straight tube =====
label{diffu:app:pipeflow}

Now we consider viscous fluid flow in a straight tube with radius $R$
and rigid walls.
The governing equations are the Navier-Stokes equations, but as
in Section ref{diffu:app:Couette}, it is natural to assume that the
velocity is directed along the tube, and that it is axi-symmetric.
These assumptions reduced the velocity field to $\u = u(r,x,t)\ii$, if the
$x$ axis is directed along the tube. From the equation of continuity,
$\nabla\cdot\u = 0$, we see that $u$ must be independent of $x$.
Inserting $\u = u(r,t)\ii$ in the Navier-Stokes equations, expressed
in axi-symmetric cylindrical coordinates, results in

!bt
\begin{equation}
\varrho\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} =
\mu\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(
r\frac{\partial u}{\partial r}\right) + \beta(t) + \varrho\gamma g,\quad
r\in [0,R],\ t\in (0,T]\tp
label{diffu:app:pipeflow:pde}
\end{equation}
!et
Here, $\beta(t) = -\partial p/\partial x$ is the pressure gradient along
the tube. The associated boundary condition is $u(R,t)=0$.

===== Tribology: thin film fluid flow =====

Thin fluid films are extremely important inside machinery to reduce friction
between gliding surfaces. The mathematical model for the fluid motion takes
the form of a diffusion problem and is quickly derived here.
We consider two solid surfaces whose distance is described by a
gap function $h(x,y)$. The space between these surfaces is filled with
a fluid with dynamic viscosity $\mu$. The fluid may move partially
because of pressure gradients and partially because the surfaces
move. Let $U\ii + V\jj$ be the relative velocity of the two surfaces and
$p$ the pressure in the fluid. The mathematical model builds on two
principles: 1) conservation of mass, 2) assumption of locally quasi-static
flow between flat plates.

The conservation of mass equation reads $\nabla\cdot\u$, where $\u$ is
the local fluid velocity. For thin films the detailed variation between
the surfaces is not of interest, so $\nabla\cdot\u = 0$ is integrated
(average) in the direction perpendicular to the surfaces. This gives
rise to the alternative mass conservation equation

!bt
\[ \nabla\cdot\q = 0,\quad \q = \int\limits_0^{h(x,y)}\u dz,\]
!et
where $z$ is the coordinate perpendicular to the surfaces, and $\q$
is then the volume flux in the fluid gap.

Locally, we may assume that we have steady flow between two flat
surfaces, with a pressure gradient and where the lower surface is at rest
and the upper moves with velocity $U\ii + V\jj$.
The corresponding mathematical problem is actually the limit problem
in Section ref{diffu:app:Couette} as $t\rightarrow\infty$. The limit
problem can be solved analytically, and the local volume flux becomes

!bt
\[ \q(x,y,z) = \int\limits_0^{h}\u(x,y,z) dz
= -\frac{h^3}{12\mu}\nabla p + \half Uh\ii + \half Vh\jj\tp\]
!et
The idea is to use this expression locally
also when the surfaces are not flat,
but slowly varying, and if $U$, $V$, or $p$ varies in time, provided the
time variation is sufficiently slow. This is a common quasi-static
approximation much used in mathematical modeling.

Inserting the expression for $\q$ via $p$, $U$, and $V$ in the
equation $\nabla\q = 0$ gives a diffusion PDE for $p$:

!bt
\begin{equation}
\nabla\cdot\left(\frac{h^3}{12\mu}\nabla p\right) =
\half\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(hU)
+ \half\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(hV)\tp
\end{equation}
!et
The boundary conditions must involve $p$ or $\q$ at the boundary.

===== Propagation of electrical signals in the brain =====

# http://people.mbi.ohio-state.edu/schwemmer.2/Publications/Schwemmer_Dissertation_Final.pdf
# The book by Peskin & ...

One can make a model of how electrical signals are propagated along the
neuronal fibers that receive synaptic inputs in the brain. The signal
propagation is one-dimensional and can, in the simplest cases, be
governed by the "Cable equation": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_equation":

!bt
\begin{equation}
c_m \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} =
\frac{1}{r_l}\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial x^2} - \frac{1}{r_m}V
label{}
\end{equation}
!et
where $V(x,t)$ is the voltage to be determined,
$c_m$ is capacitance of the neuronal fiber, while
$r_l$ and $r_m$ are measures of the resistance.
The boundary conditions are often taken as $V=0$ at a short circuit or open end,
$\partial V/\partial x=0$ at a sealed end, or $\partial V/\partial x \propto
V$ where there is an injection of current.
