This easy-to-read book introduces the basics of solving partial differential
equations by finite difference methods. The emphasis is on constructing
finite difference schemes, formulating algorithms, implementing
algorithms, verifying implementations, analyzing the physical behavior
of the numerical solutions, and applying the methods and software
to solve problems from physics and biology.
