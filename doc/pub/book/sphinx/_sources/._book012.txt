Advection-dominated equations
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Wave (the chapter :ref:`ch:wave`) and diffusion (the chapter :ref:`ch:diffu`)
equations are solved reliably by finite difference methods. As soon as
we add a first-order derivative in space, representing *advective
transport, also known as *convective* transport, the numerics gets
more complicated, and intuitively attractive methods no longer work
well. We shall show how and why such methods fail and provide
remedies. The present chapter builds on basic knowledge about finite
difference methods for diffusion and wave equations, including the
analysis by Fourier components, truncation error analysis ( :ref:`ch:trunc`), and compact difference notation.


.. admonition:: Remark on terminology

   It is common to refer to movement of a fluid as convection, while advection
   is the transport of some material dissolved or suspended in the fluid.
   We shall mostly choose the word advection here, but both terms are
   in heavy use, and for mass transport of a substance the PDE has an
   advection term, while the similar term for the heat equation is a
   convection term.




Much more comprehensive discussion of dispersion analysis for
advection problems can be found in the book by Duran [Ref15]_.
This is a an excellent resource for further studies on the topic of
advection PDEs, with emphasis on generalizations to real geophysical
problems. The book by Fletcher [Ref16]_ also has a good
overview of methods for advection and convection problems.

.. _advec:1D:

One-dimensional time-dependent advection equations
==================================================

We consider the pure advection model

.. _Eq:advec:1D:pde1:u:

.. math::

    \tag{502}
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + v\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0,\quad
         x\in (0,L),\ t\in (0,T],
        
        

.. _Eq:advec:1D:pde1:U0:

.. math::

    \tag{503}
    u(x,0) = I(x), x\in (0,L),
        
        

.. _Eq:advec:1D:pde1:I:

.. math::

    \tag{504}
    u(0,t) = U_0, t\in (0,T].
        
        

In :ref:`(502) <Eq:advec:1D:pde1:u>`, :math:`v` is a given parameter, typically reflecting
the velocity of transport of a quantity :math:`u` with a flow.
There is only one boundary condition :ref:`(503) <Eq:advec:1D:pde1:U0>` since
the spatial derivative is only first order in the PDE :ref:`(502) <Eq:advec:1D:pde1:u>`.
The information at :math:`x=0` and the initial condition get
transported in the positive :math:`x` direction
if :math:`v>0` through the domain.

It is easiest to find the solution of :ref:`(502) <Eq:advec:1D:pde1:u>` if we remove the
boundary condition and consider a process on the
infinite domain :math:`(-\infty, \infty)`. The solution is simply

.. _Eq:advec:1D:pde1:sol:

.. math::

    \tag{505}
    u(x,t) = I(x-vt){\thinspace .}
        
        

This is also the solution we expect locally in a finite domain before boundary
conditions have reflected or modified the wave.

A particular feature of the solution :ref:`(505) <Eq:advec:1D:pde1:sol>` is that

.. _Eq:advec:1D:pde1:uprop1:

.. math::

    \tag{506}
    u(x_i, t_{n+1}) = u(x_{i-1}, t_n),
        
        

if :math:`x_i=i\Delta x` and :math:`t_n=n\Delta t` are points in a uniform mesh.
We see this relation from

.. math::
         u(i\Delta x, (n+1)\Delta t) = I(i\Delta x - v(n+1)\Delta t) =
        I((i-1)\Delta x - vn\Delta t - v\Delta t - \Delta x)
        = I((i-1)\Delta x - vn\Delta t) = u((i-1)\Delta x, n\Delta t),

provided :math:`v = \Delta x/\Delta t`. So, whenever we see a scheme that
collapses to

.. _Eq:advec:1D:pde1:uprop2:

.. math::

    \tag{507}
    u^{n+1}_i = u_{i-1}^n,
        
        

for the PDE in question, we have in fact a scheme that reproduces the
analytical solution, and many of the schemes to be presented possess
this nice property!

Finally, we add that a discussion of appropriate boundary conditions
for the advection PDE in multiple dimensions is a challenching topic beyond
the scope of this text.

.. _advec:1D:FTCS:

Simplest scheme: forward in time, centered in space
---------------------------------------------------

Method          (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A first attempt to solve a PDE like :ref:`(502) <Eq:advec:1D:pde1:u>` will normally
be to look for a time-discretization scheme that is explicit so we avoid
solving systems of linear equations. In space, we anticipate that
centered differences are most accurate and therefore best. These
two arguments lead us to a Forward Euler scheme in time and
centered differences in space:

.. _Eq:_auto210:

.. math::

    \tag{508}
    [D_t^+ u + vD_{2x} u = 0]^n_i
        
        

Written out, we see that this expression reads

.. math::
         u^{n+1} = u^n - \frac{1}{2} C (u^n_{i+1}-u_{i-1}^n),

with :math:`C` as the Courant number

.. math::
         C = \frac{v\Delta t}{\Delta x}{\thinspace .}

Implementation          (9)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A solver function for our scheme goes as follows.

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    def solver_FECS(I, U0, v, L, dt, C, T, user_action=None):
        Nt = int(round(T/float(dt)))
        t = np.linspace(0, Nt*dt, Nt+1)   # Mesh points in time
        dx = v*dt/C
        Nx = int(round(L/dx))
        x = np.linspace(0, L, Nx+1)       # Mesh points in space
        # Make sure dx and dt are compatible with x and t
        dx = x[1] - x[0]
        dt = t[1] - t[0]
        C = v*dt/dx
    
        u   = np.zeros(Nx+1)
        u_n = np.zeros(Nx+1)
    
        # Set initial condition u(x,0) = I(x)
        for i in range(0, Nx+1):
            u_n[i] = I(x[i])
    
        if user_action is not None:
            user_action(u_n, x, t, 0)
    
        for n in range(0, Nt):
            # Compute u at inner mesh points
            for i in range(1, Nx):
                u[i] = u_n[i] - 0.5*C*(u_n[i+1] - u_n[i-1])
    
            # Insert boundary condition
            u[0] = U0
    
            if user_action is not None:
                user_action(u, x, t, n+1)
    
            # Switch variables before next step
            u_n, u = u, u_n

Test cases
~~~~~~~~~~

The typical solution :math:`u` has the shape of :math:`I` and is transported at
velocity :math:`v` to the right (if :math:`v>0`). Let us consider two different
initial conditions, one smooth (Gaussian pulse) and one non-smooth
(half-truncated cosine pulse):

.. _Eq:advec:1D:case_gaussian:

.. math::

    \tag{509}
    u(x,0) = Ae^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-L/10}{\sigma}\right)^2},
        
        

.. _Eq:advec:1D:case_cos:

.. math::

    \tag{510}
    u(x,0) = A\cos\left(\frac{5\pi}{L}\left( x - \frac{L}{10}\right)\right),\quad
        x < \frac{L}{5} \hbox{ else } 0{\thinspace .}
        
        

The parameter :math:`A` is the maximum value of the initial condition.

Before doing numerical simulations, we scale the PDE
problem and introduce :math:`\bar x = x/L` and :math:`\bar t= vt/L`,
which gives

.. math::
         \frac{\partial\bar u}{\partial \bar t} +
        \frac{\partial\bar u}{\partial\bar x} = 0{\thinspace .}

The unknown :math:`u` is scaled by the maximum value of the initial condition:
:math:`\bar u = u/\max |I(x)|` such that :math:`|\bar u(\bar x, 0)|\in [0,1]`.
The scaled problem is solved by setting :math:`v=1`, :math:`L=1`, and :math:`A=1`.
From now on we drop the bars.

To run our test cases and plot the solution, we make the function

.. code-block:: python

    def run_FECS(case):
        """Special function for the FECS case."""
        if case == 'gaussian':
            def I(x):
                return np.exp(-0.5*((x-L/10)/sigma)**2)
        elif case == 'cosinehat':
            def I(x):
                return np.cos(np.pi*5/L*(x - L/10)) if x < L/5 else 0
    
        L = 1.0
        sigma = 0.02
        legends = []
    
        def plot(u, x, t, n):
            """Animate and plot every m steps in the same figure."""
            plt.figure(1)
            if n == 0:
                lines = plot(x, u)
            else:
                lines[0].set_ydata(u)
                plt.draw()
                #plt.savefig()
            plt.figure(2)
            m = 40
            if n % m != 0:
                return
            print 't=%g, n=%d, u in [%g, %g] w/%d points' % \ 
                  (t[n], n, u.min(), u.max(), x.size)
            if np.abs(u).max() > 3:  # Instability?
                return
            plt.plot(x, u)
            legends.append('t=%g' % t[n])
            if n > 0:
                plt.hold('on')
    
        plt.ion()
        U0 = 0
        dt = 0.001
        C = 1
        T = 1
        solver(I=I, U0=U0, v=1.0, L=L, dt=dt, C=C, T=T,
               user_action=plot)
        plt.legend(legends, loc='lower left')
        plt.savefig('tmp.png'); plt.savefig('tmp.pdf')
        plt.axis([0, L, -0.75, 1.1])
        plt.show()

Bug?
~~~~

Running either of the test cases, the plot becomes a mess, and
the printout of :math:`u` values in the ``plot`` function reveals that
:math:`u` grows very quickly. We may reduce :math:`\Delta t` and make it
very small, yet the solution just grows.
Such behavior points to a bug in the code.
However, choosing a coarse mesh and performing a time step by
hand calculations produce the same numbers as in the code, so
it seems that the implementation is correct.
The hypothesis is therefore that the solution is unstable.

.. _advec:1D:FTCS:anal:

Analysis of the scheme
----------------------

It is easy to show that a typical Fourier component

.. math::
         u(x,t)= B\sin (k(x-ct))

is a solution of our PDE for any spatial wave length :math:`\lambda = 2\pi /k`
and any amplitude :math:`B`. (Since the PDE to be investigated by this method
is homogeneous and linear, :math:`B` will always cancel out, so we tend to skip
this amplitude, but keep it here in the beginning for completeness.)

A general solution can be thought to be build of a collection of long and
short waves such waves with different amplitudes. Algebraically, the work
simplifies if we introduce the complex Fourier component

.. math::
         u(x,t)={A_{\small\mbox{e}}}^n e^{ikx},

with

.. math::
         {A_{\small\mbox{e}}}=Be^{-ikv\Delta t} = Be^{iCkx}{\thinspace .}

Note that :math:`|{A_{\small\mbox{e}}}| \leq 1`.

It turns out that many schemes also allow a Fourier wave component as
solution, and we can use the numerically computed values of :math:`{A_{\small\mbox{e}}}`
(denoted :math:`A`) to learn about the
quality of the scheme. Hence, to analyze the difference scheme we just
have implemented, we look at how it treats the Fourier component

.. math::
         u_q^n = A^n e^{ikq\Delta x}{\thinspace .}

Inserting the numerical component in the scheme,

.. math::
         [D_t^+ A^n e^{ikq\Delta x} + v D_{2x}A^n e^{ikq\Delta x}]^n_i,

and making use of :ref:`(633) <Eq:form:exp:fd1c:center>`
results in

.. math::
         [e^{ikq\Delta x} (\frac{A-1}{\Delta t} + v\frac{1}{\Delta x}i\sin (k\Delta x))]^n_i,

which implies

.. math::
         A = 1 - iC\sin(k\Delta x){\thinspace .}

The numerical solution features the formula :math:`A^n`. To find out whether
:math:`A^n` means growth in time, we rewrite :math:`A` in polar form: :math:`A=A_re^{i\phi}`,
for real numbers :math:`A_r` and :math:`\phi`,
since we then have :math:`A^n = A_r^ne^{i\phi n}`. The magnitude of :math:`A^n` is
:math:`A_r^n`. In our case, :math:`A_r = (1 + C^2\sin^2(kx))^{1/2} > 1`, so
:math:`A_r^n` will increase in time, whereas the
exact solution will not. Regardless of :math:`\Delta t`, we get unstable
numerical solutions.

.. _advec:1D:leapfrog:

Leapfrog in time, centered differences in space
-----------------------------------------------

Method          (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another explicit scheme is to do a "leapfrog" jump over :math:`2\Delta t` in
time and combine it with central differences in space:

.. math::
         [D_{2t} u + vD_{2x} u = 0]_i^n,

which results in the updating formula

.. math::
         u^{n+1}_i = u^{n-1}_i - C^2(u_{i+1}^n-u_{i-1}^n){\thinspace .}

A special scheme is needed to compute :math:`u^1`, but we leave that problem for
now.

Implementation          (10)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We now need to work with three time levels and must modify our solver a bit:

.. code-block:: python

    Nt = int(round(T/float(dt)))
    t = np.linspace(0, Nt*dt, Nt+1)   # Mesh points in time
    ...
    u   = np.zeros(Nx+1)
    u_1 = np.zeros(Nx+1)
    u_2 = np.zeros(Nx+1)
    ...
    for n in range(0, Nt):
        if scheme == 'UP':
            for i in range(1, Nx):
                u[i] = u_1[i] - 0.5*C*(u_1[i+1] - u_1[i-1])
        elif scheme == 'LF':
            if n == 0:
                # Use some scheme for the first step
                for i in range(1, Nx):
                    ...
            else:
                for i in range(1, Nx+1):
                    u[i] = u_2[i] - C*(u_1[i] - u_1[i-1])
    
        # Switch variables before next step
        u_2, u_1, u = u_1, u, u_2

Running a test case
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let us try a coarse mesh such that the smooth Gaussian initial condition
is represented by 1 at mesh node 1 and 0 at all other nodes. This
triangular initial condition should then be advected to the right.
Choosing scaled variables as :math:`\Delta t=0.1`, :math:`T=1`, and :math:`C=1` gives
the plot in Figure :ref:`advec:1D:case_gaussian:fig:LFCS`, which
is in fact identical to the exact solution (!).

.. _advec:1D:case_gaussian:fig:LFCS:

.. figure:: solver_FE_Upw.png
   :width: 500

   Exact solution obtained by Leapfrog scheme with :math:`\Delta t = 0.1` and :math:`C=1`

Running more test cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can run two types of initial conditions for :math:`C=0.8`: one very
smooth with a Gaussian function (Figure :ref:`advec:1D:UP:fig1:C08`) and
one with a discontinuity in the first derivative (Figure
:ref:`advec:1D:UP:fig2:C08`).  Unless we have a very fine mesh, as in
the left plots in the figures, we get small ripples behind the main
wave, and this main wave has the amplitude reduced.

Analysis
~~~~~~~~

We can perform a Fourier analysis again. Inserting the numerical
Fourier component in the Leapfrog scheme, we get

.. math::
         A^2 - i2C\sin(k\Delta x) A - 1 = 0,

and

.. math::
         A = -iC\sin(k\Delta x) \pm \sqrt{1-C^2\sin^2(k\Delta x)}{\thinspace .}

Rewriting to polar form, :math:`A=A_re^{i\phi}`, we see that :math:`A_r=1`, so the
numerical component is neither increasing nor decreasing in time, which is
exactly what we want. However, for :math:`C>1`, the square root can become
complex valued, so stability is obtained only as long as :math:`C\leq 1`.

We introduce :math:`p=k\Delta x`. The amplification factor now reads

.. math::
         A = -iC\sin p \pm \sqrt{1-C^2\sin^2 p},

and is to be compared to the exact amplification factor

.. math::
         {A_{\small\mbox{e}}} = e^{-ikv\Delta t} = e^{-ikC\Delta x} = e^{-iCp}{\thinspace .}

the section :ref:`advec:1D:disprel` compares numerical amplification factors
of many schemes with the exact expression.

.. _advec:1D:FTUP:

Upwind differences in space
---------------------------

.. index:: upwind difference

Since the PDE reflects transport of information along with a flow in
positive :math:`x` direction, when :math:`v>0`, it could be natural to go (what is called)
upstream and not
downstream in a spatial derivative to collect information about the
change of the function. That is, we approximate

.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(x_i,t_n)\approx [D^-_x u]^n_i = \frac{u^n_{i} - u^n_{i-1}}{\Delta x}{\thinspace .}

This is called an *upwind difference* (the corresponding difference in the
time direction would be called a backward difference, and we could use that
name in space too, but *upwind* is the common name for a difference against
the flow in advection problems). This spatial approximation does magic
compared to
the scheme we had with Forward Euler in time and centered difference in space.
With an upwind difference,

.. _Eq:advec:1D:upwind:

.. math::

    \tag{511}
    [D^+_t u + vD^-_x u = 0]^n_i,
        
        

written out as

.. math::
         u^{n+1} = u^n_i - C(u^{n}_{i}-u^{n}_{i-1}),

gives a generally popular and robust scheme that is stable if :math:`C\leq 1`.
As with the Leapfrog scheme, it becomes exact if :math:`C=1`, exactly as shown in
Figure :ref:`advec:1D:case_gaussian:fig:LFCS`. This is easy to see since
:math:`C=1` gives the property :ref:`(507) <Eq:advec:1D:pde1:uprop2>`.
However, any :math:`C<1` gives a significant reduction in the amplitude of the
solution, which is a purely numerical effect, see Figures
:ref:`advec:1D:UP:fig1:C08` and :ref:`advec:1D:UP:fig2:C08`.
Experiments show, however, that
reducing :math:`\Delta t` or :math:`\Delta x`, while keeping :math:`C` reduces the
error.

The amplification factor can be computed using the
formula :ref:`(631) <Eq:form:exp:fd1:bw>`,

.. math::
         \frac{A - 1}{\Delta t} + \frac{v}{\Delta x}(1 - e^{-ik\Delta x}) = 0,

which means

.. math::
         A = 1 - C(1 - \cos(p) - i\sin(p)){\thinspace .}

For :math:`C<1` there is, unfortunately,
non-physical damping of discrete Fourier components, giving rise to reduced
amplitude of :math:`u^n_i` as in Figures :ref:`advec:1D:UP:fig1:C08`
and :ref:`advec:1D:UP:fig2:C08`. The damping
is this figure is seen to be quite severe.


.. admonition:: Interpretation of upwind difference as artificial diffusion

   One can interpret the upwind difference as extra, artificial diffusion
   in the equation. Solving
   
   .. math::
            \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + v\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}
           = \nu\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2},
   
   by a forward difference time and centered differences in space,
   
   .. math::
            D^+_t u + vD_{2x} u = \nu D_xD_x u]^n_i,
   
   gives actually the upwind scheme :ref:`(511) <Eq:advec:1D:upwind>` if
   :math:`\nu = v\Delta x/2`. That is, solving the PDE :math:`u_t + vu_x=0`
   by centered differences in space and forward difference in time is
   unsuccessful, but by adding some artificial diffusion :math:`\nu u_{xx}`,
   the method becomes stable:
   
   .. math::
            \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + v
           \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \left({\alpha} + \frac{v\Delta x}{2}\right)
           \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}{\thinspace .}




.. _advec:1D:periodic_BC:

Periodic boundary conditions
----------------------------

So far, we have given then value of on the left boundary, :math:`u_0^n`, and used
the scheme to propagate the solution signal through the domain.
Often, we want to follow such signals for long time series, and periodic
boundary conditions are then relevant since they enable a signal that
leaves the right boundary to immediately enter the left boundary and propagate
through the domain again.

The periodic boundary condition is

.. math::
         u(0,t) = u(L,t),\quad u_0^n = u_{N_x}^n{\thinspace .}

It means that we in the first equation, involving :math:`u_0^n`, insert :math:`u_{N_x}^n`,
and that we in the last equation, involving :math:`u^{n+1}_{N_x}` insert :math:`u^{n+1}_0`.
Normally, we can do this in the simple way that ``u_1[0]`` is updated as
``u_1[Nx]`` at the beginning of a new time level.

In some schemes we may need :math:`u^{n}_{N_x+1}` and :math:`u^{n}_{-1}`. Periodicity
then means that these values are equal to :math:`u^n_1` and :math:`u^n_{N_x-1}`,
respectively. For the upwind scheme it is sufficient to set
``u_1[0]=u_1[Nx]`` at a new time level before computing ``u[1]``, which ensures
that ``u[1]`` becomes right and at the next time level ``u[0]`` at the current
time level is correctly updated.
For the Leapfrog scheme we must update ``u[0]`` and ``u[Nx]`` using the scheme:

.. code-block:: python

    if periodic_bc:
        i = 0
        u[i] = u_2[i] - C*(u_1[i+1] - u_1[Nx-1])
    for i in range(1, Nx):
        u[i] = u_2[i] - C*(u_1[i+1] - u_1[i-1])
    if periodic_bc:
        u[Nx] = u[0]

Implementation          (11)
----------------------------

Test condition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Analytically, we can show that the integral in space under the :math:`u(x,t)` curve
is constant:

.. math::
        \begin{align*}
        \int_0^L \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + v\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}
        \right) dx &= 0\\ 
        \frac{\partial }{\partial t} \int_0^L udx &=
        - \int_0^L v\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}dx\\ 
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} \int_0^L udx &=
        [v u]_0^L =0
        \end{align*}

as long as :math:`u(0)=u(L)=0`. We can therefore use the property

.. math::
         \int_0^L u(x,t)dx = \hbox{const} 

as a partial verification during the simulation. Now, any numerical method
with :math:`C\neq 1` will deviate from the constant, expected value, so
the integral is a measure of the error in the scheme. The integral can
be computed by the Trapezoidal integration rule

.. code-block:: python

    dx*(0.5*u[0] + 0.5*u[Nx] + np.sum(u[1:-1]))

if ``u`` is an array holding the solution.

A Crank-Nicolson discretization in time and centered differences in space
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another obvious candidate for time discretization is the Crank-Nicolson
method combined with centered differences in space:

.. math::
         [D_t u]^n_i + v\frac{1}{2}([D_{2x} u]^{n+1}_i + [D_{2x} u]^{n}_i) = 0{\thinspace .}

It can be nice to include the Backward Euler scheme too, via the
:math:`\theta`-rule,

.. math::
         [D_t u]^n_i + v\theta [D_{2x} u]^{n+1}_i + v(1-\theta)[D_{2x} u]^{n}_i = 0{\thinspace .}

This gives rise to an *implicit* scheme,

.. math::
         u^{n+1}_i + \frac{\theta}{2} C (u^{n+1}_{i+1} - u^{n+1}_{i-1})
        = u^n_i - \frac{1-\theta}{2} C (u^{n}_{i+1} - u^{n}_{i-1})

for :math:`i=1,\ldots,N_x-1`. At the boundaries we set :math:`u=0` and simulate just to
the point of time when the signal hits the boundary (and gets reflected).

.. math::
         u^{n+1}_0 = u^{n+1}_{N_x} = 0{\thinspace .}

The elements on the diagonal in the matrix become:

.. math::
         A_{i,i} = 1,\quad i=0,\ldots,N_x{\thinspace .}

On the subdiagonal and superdiagonal we have

.. math::
         A_{i-1,i} = -\frac{\theta}{2} C,\quad A_{i+1,i} = \frac{\theta}{2} C,\quad i=1,\ldots,N_x-1,

with :math:`A_{0,1}=0` and :math:`A_{N_x-1,N_x}=0` due to the known boundary conditions.
And finally, the right-hand side becomes

.. math::
        \begin{align*}
        b_0 &= u^n_{N_x}\\ 
        b_i &= u^n_i - \frac{1-\theta}{2} C (u^{n}_{i+1} - u^{n}_{i-1}),\quad i=1,\ldots,N_x-1\\ 
        b_{N_x} &= u^n_0
        \end{align*}

The dispersion relation follows from inserting :math:`u^n_i = A^ne^{ikx}`
and using the formula :ref:`(633) <Eq:form:exp:fd1c:center>` for the spatial
differences:

.. math::
         A = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) i C\sin p}{1 + \theta i C\sin p}{\thinspace .}

Figure :ref:`advec:1D:CN:fig:C08` depicts a numerical solution for :math:`C=0.8`
and the Crank-Nicolson
with severe oscillations behind the main wave. These oscillations are
damped as the mesh is refined. Switching to the Backward Euler scheme
helps on the oscillations as they are removed, but the amplitude is
significantly reduced. One could expect that the discontinuous derivative
in the initial condition of the half a cosine wave would make even
stronger demands on producing a smooth profile, but Figure :ref:`advec:1D:BE:fig:C08` shows that also here, Backward-Euler is capable of producing a
smooth profile. All in all, there are no major differences between the
Gaussian initial condition and the half a cosine condition for any of
the schemes.

.. _advec:1D:LaxW:

The Lax-Wendroff method
-----------------------

The Lax-Wendroff method is based on three ideas:

1. Express the new unknown :math:`u^{n+1}_i` in terms of known
   quantities at :math:`t=t_n` by means of a Taylor polynomial of second degree.

2. Replace time-derivatives at :math:`t=t_n` by spatial derivatives,
   using the PDE.

3. Discretize the spatial derivatives by second-order differences so we
   achieve a scheme of accuracy :math:`{\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^2)} + {\mathcal{O}(\Delta x^2)}`.

Let us follow the recipe. First we have the three-term Taylor polynomial,

.. math::
         u^{n+1}_i = u^n_i + \Delta t\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}\right)^n_i
        + \frac{1}{2}\Delta t^2\left(\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2}\right)^n_i{\thinspace .}

From the PDE we have that temporal derivatives can be substituted by
spatial derivatives:

.. math::
         \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = -v\frac{\partial u}{\partial x},

and furthermore,

.. math::
         \frac{\partial ^2}{\partial t^2} = v^2\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}{\thinspace .}

Inserted in the Taylor polynomial formula, we get

.. math::
         u^{n+1}_i = u^n_i -v \Delta t\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right)^n_i
        + \frac{1}{2}\Delta t^2 v^2
        \left(\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}\right)^n_i{\thinspace .}

To obtain second-order accuracy in space we now use central differences:

.. math::
         u^{n+1}_i = u^n_i -v \Delta t [D_{2x} u]^n_i
        + \frac{1}{2}\Delta t^2 v^2 [D_xD_x u]^n_i,

or written out,

.. math::
         u^{n+1}_i = u^n_i - C (u^{n}_{i+1} - u^{n}_{i-1})
        + \frac{1}{2} C^2 (u^{n}_{i+1}-2u^n_i+u^n_{i-1}){\thinspace .}

This is the explicit Lax-Wendroff scheme.


.. admonition:: Lax-Wendroff works because of artificial viscosity

   We can immediately from the formulas above
   see that the Lax-Wendroff method is nothing but
   a Forward Euler, central difference in space scheme, which we have shown
   to be useless because of chronic instability, plus an artificial
   diffusion term of strength :math:`\frac{1}{2}\Delta t v^2`. It means that we can take
   an unstable scheme and add some diffusion to stabilize it. This is a common
   trick to deal with advection problems. Sometimes, the real physical diffusion
   is not sufficiently large to make schemes stable, so then we also add
   artificial diffusion.

.. MOVIE: [fig-advec/

From an analysis similar to the ones carried out above, we get an
amplification factor for the Lax-Wendroff method that equals

.. math::
         A = 1 - iC\sin p - 2C^2\sin^2 (p/2){\thinspace .}

This means that :math:`|A|=1` and also that we have an exact solution of :math:`C=1`!

.. _advec:1D:disprel:

Analysis of dispersion relations
--------------------------------

We have developed expressions for :math:`A(C,p)` in the exact solution
:math:`u_q^n=A^ne^{ikq\Delta x}` of the discrete equations. These
expressions are valuable for investigating the quality of the numerical
solutions,see the file
`dispersion_analysis.py <http://tinyurl.com/nu656p2/advec/advec/dispersion_analysis.py>`__.
Note that the Fourier component that solves the original
PDE problem has no damping and moves with constant velocity :math:`v`. There
are two basic errors in the numerical Fourier component: there may be
damping and the wave velocity may depend on :math:`C` and :math:`p=k\Delta x`.

The shortest wavelength that can be represented is :math:`\lambda = 2\Delta x`.
The corresponding :math:`k` is :math:`k=2\pi/\lambda = \pi/\Delta x`, so :math:`p=k\Delta x\in
(0,\pi]`.

Given a complex :math:`A` as a function of :math:`C` and :math:`p`, how can we visualize
it? The two key ingredients in :math:`A` is the magnitude, reflecting damping or
growth of the wave, and the angle, closely related to the
velocity of the wave. The Fourier component

.. math::
         D^n e^{ik(x-ct)}

has damping :math:`D` and wave velocity :math:`c`. Let us express our :math:`A` in
polar form, :math:`A = A_re^{i\phi}`, and insert this expression in
our discrete component :math:`u_q^n = A^ne^{ikq\Delta x} = A^ne^{ikx}`:

.. math::
        
        u^n_q = A_r^n e^{i\phi n} e^{ikx} = A_r^n e^{i(kx - n\phi)} =
        A_r^ne^{i(k(x - ct))},

for

.. math::
        
        c = \frac{\phi}{k\Delta t}{\thinspace .}
        

Now,

.. math::
         k\Delta t = \frac{Ck\Delta x}{v}=\frac{Cp}{v},

so

.. math::
         c = \frac{\phi v}{Cp}{\thinspace .}

An appropriate dimensionless quantity to plot is the scaled wave velocity :math:`c/v`:

.. math::
         \frac{c}{v} = \frac{\phi}{Cp}{\thinspace .}

Figures
:ref:`advec:1D:disprel:C1:1`--:ref:`advec:1D:disprel:C05:2` contain
dispersion curves, velocity and damping, for various values of :math:`C`.
The horizontal axis shows the dimensionless frequency :math:`p` of the wave,
while the figures to the left illustrate the error in wave velocity :math:`c/v`
(should ideally be 1 for all :math:`p`), and the figures to the right display
the absolute value (magnitude) of the damping factor :math:`A_r`.
The curves are labeled according to the table below.

   Dispersion relations for :math:`C=0.5`

The total damping after some time :math:`T=n\Delta t` is reflected by
:math:`A_r(C,p)^n`. Since normally :math:`A_r<1`, the damping goes like
:math:`A_r^{1/\Delta t}` and approaches zero as :math:`\Delta t\rightarrow 0`.
The only two ways to reduce the damping are to increase :math:`C` and the mesh
resolution.

We can learn a lot from the dispersion relation plots. For example,
looking at the plots for :math:`C=1`, the schemes LW, UP, and LF has no
amplitude reduction, but LF has a wrong phase velocity for the
shortest wave in the mesh. This wave does not (normally) have enough
amplitude to be seen, so for all practical purposes, there is no
damping or wrong velocity of the individual waves, so the total shape
of the wave is also correct. For the CN scheme, see Figure
:ref:`advec:1D:CN:fig:C08`, each individual wave has its amplitude, but
they move with different velocities, so after a while, we see some of
these waves lagging behind.  For the BE scheme, see Figure
:ref:`advec:1D:BE:fig:C08`, each of the shorter waves are so heavily
damped that we cannot see them after a while. All the we see are the
very longest wave, which have slightly wrong velocity, but visible
amplitudes are sufficiently equal to produce what looks like a smooth
profile.

Another feature was that the Leapfrog method produced oscillations,
while the upwind scheme did not. Since the Leapfrog method does not
damp the shorter waves, which have wrong wave velocities of order 10
percent, we can see these waves as noise. The upwind scheme, however,
damp these waves. The same effect is also present in the Lax-Wendroff
scheme, but the damping of the intermediate waves is hardly present, so
there is visible noise in the total signal.

We realize that there is more understanding of the
behavior of the schemes in the dispersion analysis compared with a
pure truncation error analysis. The latter just says Lax-Wendroff is
better than upwind, because of the increased order in time, but
most people would say upwind is the better by looking at the plots.

.. _advec:1D:stationary:

One-dimensional stationary advection-diffusion equation
=======================================================

Now we pay attention to a physical process where advection (or convection)
is in balance with diffusion:

.. _Eq:advec:1D:stat:pde1:

.. math::

    \tag{512}
    v\frac{du}{dx} = {\alpha}\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2}{\thinspace .}
        
        

For simplicity, we assume :math:`v` and :math:`{\alpha}` to be constant, but the extension to
the variable-coefficient case is trivial.
This equation can be viewed as the stationary limit of the corresponding
time-dependent problem

.. _Eq:advec:1D:stat:pde2:

.. math::

    \tag{513}
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + v\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} =
        {\alpha}\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}{\thinspace .}
        
        

Equations of the form :ref:`(512) <Eq:advec:1D:stat:pde1>` or
:ref:`(513) <Eq:advec:1D:stat:pde2>` arise from transport phenomena, either mass
or heat transport. One can also view the equations as a simple model
problem for the Navier-Stokes equations. With the chosen boundary
conditions, the differential equation problem models the phenomenon of
a *boundary layer*, where the solution changes rapidly very close to
the boundary. This is a characteristic of many fluid flow problems and
make strong demands to numerical methods. The fundamental numerical
difficulty is related to non-physical oscillations of the solution
(instability) if the first-derivative spatial term dominates over the
second-derivative term.

.. _advec:1D:stationary:model:

A simple model problem          (1)
-----------------------------------

We consider :ref:`(512) <Eq:advec:1D:stat:pde1>` on :math:`[0,L]` equipped with the
boundary conditions :math:`u(0)=U_0`, :math:`u(L)=U_L`.  By scaling we can reduce the
number of parameters in the problem. We scale :math:`x` by :math:`\bar x = x/L`,
and :math:`u` by

.. math::
         \bar u = \frac{u - u_0}{u_L-u_0}{\thinspace .}

Inserted in the governing equation we get

.. math::
         \frac{v(u_L-u_0)}{L}\frac{d\bar u}{d\bar x} =
        \frac{{\alpha}(u_L-u_0)}{L^2}\frac{d^2\bar u}{d\bar x^2},\quad
        \bar u(0)=0,\ \bar u(1)=1{\thinspace .}

Dropping the bars is common. We can then simplify to

.. _Eq:advec:1D:stat:pde1s:

.. math::

    \tag{514}
    \frac{du}{dx} = \epsilon\frac{d^2 u}{d x^2},\quad u(0)=0,\ u(1)=1{\thinspace .}
        
        

There are two competing effects in this equation: the advection term
transports signals to the right, while the diffusion term transports
signals to the left and the right. The value :math:`u(0)=0` is transported
through the domain if :math:`\epsilon` is small, and :math:`u\approx 0` except in
the vicinity of :math:`x=0`, where :math:`u(1)=1` and the diffusion transports
some information about :math:`u(1)=1` to the left. For large :math:`\epsilon`,
diffusion dominates and the :math:`u` takes on the "average" value, i.e.,
:math:`u` gets a linear variation from 0 to 1 throughout the domain.

It turns out that we can find an exact solution to the differential
equation problem and also to many of its discretizations. This is one
reason why this model problem has been so successful in designing and
investigating numerical methods for mixed convection/advection and
diffusion.  The exact solution reads

.. math::
         {u_{\small\mbox{e}}} (x) = \frac{e^{x/\epsilon} - 1}{e^{1/\epsilon} - 1}{\thinspace .}

The forthcoming plots illustrates this function for various values of
:math:`\epsilon`.

.. _advec:1D:stationary:fdm:

A centered finite difference scheme          (2)
------------------------------------------------

The most obvious idea to solve :ref:`(514) <Eq:advec:1D:stat:pde1s>` is to apply
centered differences:

.. math::
         [D_{2x} u = \epsilon D_xD_x u]_i 

for :math:`i=1,\ldots,N_x-1`, with :math:`u_0=0` and :math:`u_{N_x}=1`.
Note that this is a coupled system of algebraic equations
involving :math:`u_0,\ldots,u_{N_x}`.

Written out, the scheme becomes a tridiagonal system

.. math::
         A_{i-1,i}u_{i-1} + A_{i,i}u_i + A_{i+1.i}u_{i+1} = 0,

for :math:`i=1,\ldots,N_x-1`

.. math::
        \begin{align*}
        A_{0,0} &= 1,\\ 
        A_{i-1,i} &= -\frac{1}{\Delta x} -\epsilon\frac{1}{\Delta x^2},\\ 
        A_{i,i} &= 2\epsilon\frac{1}{\Delta x^2},\\ 
        A_{i,i+1} &=  \frac{1}{\Delta x} -\epsilon\frac{1}{\Delta x^2},\\ 
        A_{N_x,N_x} &= 1{\thinspace .}
        \end{align*}

The right-hand side of the linear system is zero except :math:`b_{N_x}=1`.

Figure :ref:`advec:1D:stationary:fdm:fig1` shows reasonably accurate
results with :math:`N_x=20` and :math:`N_x=40` cells in :math:`x` direction and a value of
:math:`\epsilon = 0.1`. Decreasing :math:`\epsilon` to :math:`0.01` leads to oscillatory
solutions as depicted in Figure :ref:`advec:1D:stationary:fdm:fig2`.
This is, unfortunately, a typical phenomenon in this type of problem:
non-physical oscillations arise for small :math:`\epsilon` unless the resolution
:math:`N_x` is not big enough. :ref:`advec:1D:stationary:exer:analysis1`
develops a precise criterion: :math:`u` is oscillation-free if

.. math::
         \Delta x \leq \frac{2}{\epsilon}{\thinspace .}

If we take the present model as a simplified model for a *viscous
boundary layer* in real, industrial fluid flow applications,
:math:`\epsilon\sim 10^{-6}`
and million of cells are required to resolve the boundary layer.
Fortunately, this is not strictly necessary as we have methods in
the next section to overcome the problem!

.. _advec:1D:stationary:upwind:

Remedy: upwind finite difference scheme
---------------------------------------

The scheme can be stabilized by letting the advective transport term, which
is the dominating term, collect its information in the flow direction, i.e.,
upstream or upwind of the point in question. So, instead of using a
centered difference

.. math::
         \frac{du}{dx}_i\approx \frac{u_{i+1}-u_{i-1}}{2\Delta x},

we use the one-sided *upwind* difference

.. math::
         \frac{du}{dx}_i\approx \frac{u_{i}-u_{i-1}}{2\Delta x},

in case :math:`v>0`. For :math:`v<0` we set

.. math::
         \frac{du}{dx}_i\approx \frac{u_{i+1}-u_{i}}{2\Delta x},

On compact operator notation form, our upwind scheme can be expressed
as

.. math::
         [D^-_x u = \epsilon D_xD_x u]_i 

provided :math:`v>0` (and :math:`\epsilon > 0`).

We write out the equations and implement them as shown in the program
in the section :ref:`advec:1D:stationary:fdm`. The results appear in Figures
:ref:`advec:1D:stationary:upwind:fig1` and
:ref:`advec:1D:stationary:upwind:fig2`: no more oscillations!

   Comparison of exact and numerical solution for :math:`\epsilon =0.01` and :math:`N_x=20,40` with upwind difference

We see that the upwind scheme is always stable, but it gives a thicker
boundary layer when the centered scheme is also stable.
Why the upwind scheme is always stable is easy to understand as
soon as we undertake the mathematical analysis in
:ref:`advec:1D:stationary:exer:analysis1`.
Moreover, the thicker layer (seemingly larger diffusion) can be
understood by doing
:ref:`advec:1D:stationary:exer:analysis2`.


.. admonition:: Exact solution for this model problem

   It turns out that one can introduce a linear combination of the centered
   and upwind differences for the first-derivative term in this model
   problem. One can then adjust the weight in the linear combination so that
   the numerical solution becomes identical to the analytical solution of
   the differential equation problem at any mesh point.
   
   .. This approach cannot be generalized to more complicated problems.




Time-dependent convection-diffusion equations
=============================================

Now it is time to combine time-dependency, convection (advection) and
diffusion into one equation:

.. _Eq:advec:1D:stat:pde3:

.. math::

    \tag{515}
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + v\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} =
        {\alpha}\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}{\thinspace .}
        
        

Analytical insight
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The diffusion is now dominated by convection, a wave, and diffusion, a loss
of amplitude. One possible analytical solution is a traveling Gaussian
function

.. math::
         u(x,t) = B\exp{\left(-\left(\frac{x - vt}{4at}\right)\right)}{\thinspace .}

This function moves with velocity :math:`v>0` to the right
(:math:`v<0` to the left) due to convection, but at the same time we have a damping
:math:`e^{-16a^2t^2}` from diffusion.

Forward in time, centered in space scheme
-----------------------------------------

The Forward Euler for the diffusion equation is a successful scheme, but it
has a very strict stability condition. The similar Forward in time, centered
in space strategy always gives unstable solutions for the advection PDE.
What happens when we have both diffusion and advection present at once?

.. math::
         [D_t u + vD_{2x} u = {\alpha} D_xD_x u + f]_i^n{\thinspace .} 

We expect that diffusion will stabilize the scheme, but that advection will
destabilize it.

Another problem is non-physical oscillations, but not growing amplitudes,
due to centered differences in the advection term. There will hence be
two types of instabilities to consider.
Our analysis showed that pure advection with centered
differences in space needs some artificial diffusion to become stable
(and then it produces upwind differences for the advection term).
Adding more physical diffusion should further help the numerics to stabilize
the non-physical oscillations.

The scheme is quickly implemented, but suffers from the need for small
space and time steps, according to this reasoning. A better approach is
to get rid of the non-physical oscillations in space by simply applying
an upwind difference on the advection term.

Forward in time, upwind in space scheme
---------------------------------------

A good approximation for the pure advection equation is to use upwind
discretization of the advection term. We also know that centered differences
are good for the diffusion term, so let us combine these two discretizations:

.. _Eq:_auto211:

.. math::

    \tag{516}
    [D_t u + vD^-_{x} u = {\alpha} D_xD_x u + f]_i^n,
        
        

for :math:`v>0`. Use :math:`vD^+ u` if :math:`v<0`.
In this case the physical diffusion and the extra numerical diffusion
:math:`v\Delta x/2` will stabilize the solution, but give an overall too large
reduction in amplitude compared with the exact solution.

We may also interpret the upwind difference as artificial numerical diffusion
and centered differences in space everywhere, so the scheme can be expressed as

.. _Eq:_auto212:

.. math::

    \tag{517}
    [D_t u + vD^-_{2x} u = {\alpha} \frac{v\Delta x}{2}) D_xD_x u + f]_i^n{\thinspace .}
        
        

.. _advec:2D:

Two-dimensional advection-diffusion equations
=============================================

.. _advec:app:

Applications of advection equations
===================================

There are two major areas where advection and convection applications arises:
transport of a substance and heat transport *in a fluid*.
To derive the models, we may look at the similar derivations of
diffusion models in the section :ref:`diffu:app`,
but change the assumption from a solid to fluid medium.
This gives rise to the extra advection or convection term :math:`\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\nabla u`.
We briefly show how this is done.

Normally, transport in a fluid is dominated by the fluid flow and not
diffusion, so we can neglect diffusion compared to advection or convection.
The end result is anyway an equation of the form

.. math::
         \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{v}\cdot\nabla u = 0{\thinspace .}

.. _advec:app:mass:

Transport of a substance
------------------------

The diffusion of a substance in the section :ref:`diffu:app:substance` takes place
in a solid medium, but in a fluid we can have two transport mechanisms:
one by diffusion and one by advection.
The letter arises from the fact
that the substance particles are moved with the fluid velocity :math:`\boldsymbol{v}` such that
the effective flux now consists of two and not only one component as in
:ref:`(470) <Eq:diffu:app:substance:Fick>`:

.. math::
         \boldsymbol{q} = -{\alpha}\nabla c + \boldsymbol{v}\c{\thinspace .}

Inserted in the equation :math:`\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{q} = 0` we get the extra advection
term :math:`\nabla\cdot (\boldsymbol{v}\c)`. Very often we deal with incompressible flows,
:math:`\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{v} = 0` such that the advective term becomes :math:`\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\nabla c`.
The mass transport equation for a substance then reads

.. _Eq:_auto213:

.. math::

    \tag{518}
    \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{v}\cdot\nabla c = {\alpha}\nabla^2 c{\thinspace .}
        
        

.. _advec:app:heat:

Transport of a heat
-------------------

The derivation of the heat equation in the section :ref:`diffu:app:heat` is limited
to heat transport in solid bodies. If we turn the attention to heat transport
in fluids, we get a material derivative of the internal energy in
:ref:`(472) <Eq:diffu:app:heat:PDE1>`,

.. math::
         \frac{De}{dt} - \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{q},

and more terms if work by stresses is also included, where

.. math::
         \frac{De}{dt} = \frac{\partial e}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{v}\cdot\nabla e,

:math:`\boldsymbol{v}` being the velocity of the fluid. The convective term
:math:`\boldsymbol{v}\nabla e` must therefore be added to the governing equation,
resulting typically in

.. _Eq:advec:app:heat:PDE:

.. math::

    \tag{519}
    \varrho c\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{v}\cdot\nabla T\right)
        = \nabla\cdot(k\nabla T) + f,
        
        

where :math:`f` is some external heating inside the medium.

**Hint.**
The difference equations allow solutions on the form :math:`A^i`, where
:math:`A` is an unknown constant and :math:`i` is a mesh point counter.
There are two solutions for :math:`A`, so the general solution is a linear
combination of the two, where the constants in the linear combination
are determined from the boundary conditions.

Consider an upwind, one-sided difference approximation to
a term :math:`du/dx` in a differential equation. Show that this
