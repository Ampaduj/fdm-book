Generalization: damping, nonlinear spring, and external excitation
==================================================================

.. index:: nonlinear restoring force

.. index:: nonlinear spring

.. index:: forced vibrations

We shall now generalize the simple model problem from
the section :ref:`vib:model1` to include a possibly nonlinear damping term :math:`f(u^{\prime})`,
a possibly nonlinear spring (or restoring) force :math:`s(u)`, and
some external excitation :math:`F(t)`:

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:

.. math::

    \tag{58}
    mu^{\prime\prime} + f(u^{\prime}) + s(u) = F(t),\quad u(0)=I,\ u^{\prime}(0)=V,\ t\in (0,T]
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

We have also included a possibly nonzero initial value of :math:`u^{\prime}(0)`.
The parameters :math:`m`, :math:`f(u^{\prime})`, :math:`s(u)`, :math:`F(t)`, :math:`I`, :math:`V`, and :math:`T` are
input data.

There are two main types of damping (friction) forces: linear :math:`f(u^{\prime})=bu`, or
quadratic :math:`f(u^{\prime})=bu^{\prime}|u^{\prime}|`. Spring systems often feature linear
damping, while air resistance usually gives rise to quadratic damping.
Spring forces are often linear: :math:`s(u)=cu`, but nonlinear versions
are also common, the most famous is the gravity force on a pendulum
that acts as a spring with :math:`s(u)\sim \sin(u)`.

A centered scheme for linear damping
------------------------------------

Sampling :ref:`(58) <Eq:vib:ode2>` at a mesh point :math:`t_n`, replacing
:math:`u^{\prime\prime}(t_n)` by :math:`[D_tD_tu]^n`, and :math:`u^{\prime}(t_n)` by :math:`[D_{2t}u]^n` results
in the discretization

.. _Eq:_auto22:

.. math::

    \tag{59}
    [mD_tD_t u + f(D_{2t}u) + s(u) = F]^n,
        
        

which written out means

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:step3b:

.. math::

    \tag{60}
    m\frac{u^{n+1}-2u^n + u^{n-1}}{\Delta t^2}
        + f(\frac{u^{n+1}-u^{n-1}}{2\Delta t}) + s(u^n) = F^n,
        
        

where :math:`F^n` as usual means :math:`F(t)` evaluated at :math:`t=t_n`.
Solving :ref:`(60) <Eq:vib:ode2:step3b>` with respect to the unknown
:math:`u^{n+1}` gives a problem: the :math:`u^{n+1}` inside the :math:`f` function
makes the equation *nonlinear* unless :math:`f(u^{\prime})` is a linear function,
:math:`f(u^{\prime})=bu^{\prime}`. For now we shall assume that :math:`f` is linear in :math:`u^{\prime}`.
Then

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:step3b2:

.. math::

    \tag{61}
    m\frac{u^{n+1}-2u^n + u^{n-1}}{\Delta t^2}
        + b\frac{u^{n+1}-u^{n-1}}{2\Delta t} + s(u^n) = F^n,
        
        

which gives an explicit formula for :math:`u` at each
new time level:

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:step4:

.. math::

    \tag{62}
    u^{n+1} = (2mu^n + (\frac{b}{2}\Delta t - m)u^{n-1} +
        \Delta t^2(F^n - s(u^n)))(m + \frac{b}{2}\Delta t)^{-1}
        
        {\thinspace .}
        

For the first time step we need to discretize :math:`u^{\prime}(0)=V`
as :math:`[D_{2t}u = V]^0` and combine
with :ref:`(62) <Eq:vib:ode2:step4>` for :math:`n=0`. The discretized initial condition
leads to

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:ic:du:

.. math::

    \tag{63}
    u^{-1} = u^{1} - 2\Delta t V,
        
        

which inserted in :ref:`(62) <Eq:vib:ode2:step4>` for :math:`n=0` gives an equation
that can be solved for
:math:`u^1`:

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:step4b:

.. math::

    \tag{64}
    u^1 = u^0 + \Delta t\, V
        + \frac{\Delta t^2}{2m}(-bV - s(u^0) + F^0)
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

.. _vib:ode2:fdm:fquad:

A centered scheme for quadratic damping
---------------------------------------

When :math:`f(u^{\prime})=bu^{\prime}|u^{\prime}|`, we get a quadratic equation for :math:`u^{n+1}`
in :ref:`(60) <Eq:vib:ode2:step3b>`. This equation can be straightforwardly
solved by the well-known formula for the roots of a quadratic equation.
However, we can also avoid the nonlinearity by introducing
an approximation with an error of order no higher than what we
already have from replacing derivatives with finite differences.

.. index:: geometric mean

.. index::
   single: averaging; geometric

We start with :ref:`(58) <Eq:vib:ode2>` and only replace
:math:`u^{\prime\prime}` by :math:`D_tD_tu`, resulting in

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:quad:idea1:

.. math::

    \tag{65}
    [mD_tD_t u + bu^{\prime}|u^{\prime}| + s(u) = F]^n{\thinspace .}
        
        

Here, :math:`u^{\prime}|u^{\prime}|` is to be computed at time :math:`t_n`. The idea
is now to introduce
a *geometric mean*, defined by

.. math::
         (w^2)^n \approx w^{n-\frac{1}{2}}w^{n+\frac{1}{2}},

for some quantity :math:`w` depending on time. The error in the geometric mean
approximation is :math:`{\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^2)}`, the same as in the
approximation :math:`u^{\prime\prime}\approx D_tD_tu`. With :math:`w=u^{\prime}` it follows
that

.. math::
         [u^{\prime}|u^{\prime}|]^n \approx u^{\prime}(t_{n+\frac{1}{2}})|u^{\prime}(t_{n-\frac{1}{2}})|{\thinspace .}

The next step is to approximate
:math:`u^{\prime}` at :math:`t_{n\pm 1/2}`, and fortunately a centered difference
fits perfectly into the formulas since it involves :math:`u` values at
the mesh points only. With the approximations

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:quad:idea2:

.. math::

    \tag{66}
    u^{\prime}(t_{n+1/2})\approx [D_t u]^{n+\frac{1}{2}},\quad u^{\prime}(t_{n-1/2})\approx [D_t u]^{n-\frac{1}{2}},
        
        

we get

.. _Eq:_auto23:

.. math::

    \tag{67}
    [u^{\prime}|u^{\prime}|]^n
        \approx [D_tu]^{n+\frac{1}{2}}|[D_tu]^{n-\frac{1}{2}}| = \frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{\Delta t}
        \frac{|u^n-u^{n-1}|}{\Delta t}
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

The counterpart to :ref:`(60) <Eq:vib:ode2:step3b>` is then

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:step3b:quad:

.. math::

    \tag{68}
    m\frac{u^{n+1}-2u^n + u^{n-1}}{\Delta t^2}
        + b\frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{\Delta t}\frac{|u^n-u^{n-1}|}{\Delta t}
        + s(u^n) = F^n,
        
        

which is linear in the unknown :math:`u^{n+1}`. Therefore, we can easily solve
:ref:`(68) <Eq:vib:ode2:step3b:quad>`
with respect to :math:`u^{n+1}` and achieve the explicit updating formula

.. math::
        
        u^{n+1} =  \left( m + b|u^n-u^{n-1}|\right)^{-1}\times \nonumber
        

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:step4:quad:

.. math::

    \tag{69}
    \qquad \left(2m u^n - mu^{n-1} + bu^n|u^n-u^{n-1}| + \Delta t^2 (F^n - s(u^n))
        \right)
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

.. Make exercise to solve complicated u^1 equation with Bisection/Newton

In the derivation of a special equation for the first
time step we run into some trouble: inserting :ref:`(63) <Eq:vib:ode2:ic:du>`
in :ref:`(69) <Eq:vib:ode2:step4:quad>` for :math:`n=0` results in a complicated nonlinear
equation for :math:`u^1`. By thinking differently about the problem we can
easily get away with the nonlinearity again. We have for :math:`n=0` that
:math:`b[u^{\prime}|u^{\prime}|]^0 = bV|V|`. Using this value in :ref:`(65) <Eq:vib:ode2:quad:idea1>`
gives

.. _Eq:_auto24:

.. math::

    \tag{70}
    [mD_tD_t u + bV|V| + s(u) = F]^0
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

Writing this equation out and using :ref:`(63) <Eq:vib:ode2:ic:du>` results in the
special equation for the first time step:

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:step4b:quad:

.. math::

    \tag{71}
    u^1 = u^0 + \Delta t V + \frac{\Delta t^2}{2m}\left(-bV|V| - s(u^0) + F^0\right)
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

A forward-backward discretization of the quadratic damping term
---------------------------------------------------------------

The previous section first proposed to discretize the quadratic
damping term :math:`|u^{\prime}|u^{\prime}` using centered differences:
:math:`[|D_{2t}|D_{2t}u]^n`. As this gives rise to a nonlinearity in
:math:`u^{n+1}`, it was instead proposed to use a geometric mean combined
with centered differences.  But there are other alternatives. To get
rid of the nonlinearity in :math:`[|D_{2t}|D_{2t}u]^n`, one can think
differently: apply a backward difference to :math:`|u^{\prime}|`, such that
the term involves known values, and apply a forward difference to
:math:`u^{\prime}` to make the term linear in the unknown :math:`u^{n+1}`. With
mathematics,

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:nonlin:fbdiff:

.. math::

    \tag{72}
    [\beta |u^{\prime}|u^{\prime}]^n \approx \beta |[D_t^-u]^n|[D_t^+ u]^n =
        \beta\left\vert\frac{u^n-u^{n-1}}{\Delta t}\right\vert
        \frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{\Delta t}{\thinspace .}
        
        

The forward and backward differences have both an error proportional
to :math:`\Delta t` so one may think the discretization above leads to
a first-order scheme.
However, by looking at the formulas, we realize that the forward-backward
differences in :ref:`(72) <Eq:vib:ode2:nonlin:fbdiff>`
result in exactly the same scheme as in
:ref:`(68) <Eq:vib:ode2:step3b:quad>` where we
used a geometric mean and centered differences and committed errors
of size :math:`{\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^2)}`. Therefore, the forward-backward
differences in :ref:`(72) <Eq:vib:ode2:nonlin:fbdiff>`
act in a symmetric way and actually produce a second-order
accurate discretization of the quadratic damping term.

.. _vib:ode2:solver:

Implementation          (3)
---------------------------

The algorithm arising from the methods in the sections :ref:`vib:ode2:fdm:flin`
and :ref:`vib:ode2:fdm:fquad` is very similar to the undamped case in
the section :ref:`vib:ode1:fdm`. The difference is
basically a question of different formulas for :math:`u^1` and
:math:`u^{n+1}`. This is actually quite remarkable. The equation
:ref:`(58) <Eq:vib:ode2>` is normally impossible to solve by pen and paper, but
possible for some special choices of :math:`F`, :math:`s`, and :math:`f`. On the
contrary, the complexity of the
nonlinear generalized model :ref:`(58) <Eq:vib:ode2>` versus the
simple undamped model is not a big deal when we solve the
problem numerically!

The computational algorithm takes the form

 1. :math:`u^0=I`

 2. compute :math:`u^1` from :ref:`(64) <Eq:vib:ode2:step4b>` if linear
    damping or :ref:`(71) <Eq:vib:ode2:step4b:quad>` if quadratic damping

 3. for :math:`n=1,2,\ldots,N_t-1`:

   1. compute :math:`u^{n+1}` from :ref:`(62) <Eq:vib:ode2:step4>` if linear
      damping or :ref:`(69) <Eq:vib:ode2:step4:quad>` if quadratic damping

Modifying the ``solver`` function for the undamped case is fairly
easy, the big difference being many more terms and if tests on
the type of damping:

.. code-block:: python

        def solver(I, V, m, b, s, F, dt, T, damping='linear'):
            """
            Solve m*u'' + f(u') + s(u) = F(t) for t in (0,T],
            u(0)=I and u'(0)=V,
            by a central finite difference method with time step dt.
            If damping is 'linear', f(u')=b*u, while if damping is
            'quadratic', f(u')=b*u'*abs(u').
            F(t) and s(u) are Python functions.
            """
            dt = float(dt); b = float(b); m = float(m) # avoid integer div.
            Nt = int(round(T/dt))
            u = np.zeros(Nt+1)
            t = np.linspace(0, Nt*dt, Nt+1)
        
            u[0] = I
            if damping == 'linear':
                u[1] = u[0] + dt*V + dt**2/(2*m)*(-b*V - s(u[0]) + F(t[0]))
            elif damping == 'quadratic':

                       dt**2/(2*m)*(-b*V*abs(V) - s(u[0]) + F(t[0]))
        
            for n in range(1, Nt):
                if damping == 'linear':
                    u[n+1] = (2*m*u[n] + (b*dt/2 - m)*u[n-1] +
                              dt**2*(F(t[n]) - s(u[n])))/(m + b*dt/2)
                elif damping == 'quadratic':
                    u[n+1] = (2*m*u[n] - m*u[n-1] + b*u[n]*abs(u[n] - u[n-1])
                              + dt**2*(F(t[n]) - s(u[n])))/\ 
                              (m + b*abs(u[n] - u[n-1]))
            return u, t

.. _vib:ode2:verify:

Verification          (2)
-------------------------

Constant solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For debugging and initial verification, a constant solution is often
very useful. We choose :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(t)=I`, which implies :math:`V=0`.
Inserted in the ODE, we get
:math:`F(t)=s(I)` for any choice of :math:`f`. Since the discrete derivative
of a constant vanishes (in particular, :math:`[D_{2t}I]^n=0`,
:math:`[D_tI]^n=0`, and :math:`[D_tD_t I]^n=0`), the constant solution also fulfills
the discrete equations. The constant should therefore be reproduced
to machine precision. The function ``test_constant`` in ``vib.py``
implements this test.

[**hpl 8**: Add verification tests for constant, linear, quadratic. Check how many bugs that are caught by these tests.]

Linear solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we choose a linear solution: :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}} = ct + d`. The initial condition
:math:`u(0)=I` implies :math:`d=I`, and :math:`u^{\prime}(0)=V` forces :math:`c` to be :math:`V`.
Inserting :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}=Vt+I` in the ODE with linear damping results in

.. math::
         0 + bV + s(Vt+I) = F(t),

while quadratic damping requires the source term

.. math::
         0 + b|V|V + s(Vt+I) = F(t){\thinspace .}

Since the finite difference approximations used to compute :math:`u^{\prime}` all
are exact for a linear function, it turns out that the linear :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}`
is also a solution of the discrete equations.
:ref:`vib:exer:verify:gen:linear` asks you to carry out
all the details.

Quadratic solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Choosing :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}} = bt^2 + Vt + I`, with :math:`b` arbitrary,
fulfills the initial conditions and
fits the ODE if :math:`F` is adjusted properly. The solution also solves
the discrete equations with linear damping. However, this quadratic
polynomial in :math:`t` does not fulfill the discrete equations in case
of quadratic damping, because the geometric mean used in the approximation
of this term introduces an error.
Doing :ref:`vib:exer:verify:gen:linear` will reveal
the details. One can fit :math:`F^n` in the discrete equations such that
the quadratic polynomial is reproduced by the numerical method (to
machine precision).

Visualization
-------------

The functions for visualizations differ significantly from
those in the undamped case in the ``vib_undamped.py`` program because,
in the present general case, we do not have an exact solution to
include in the plots. Moreover, we have no good estimate of
the periods of the oscillations as there will be one period
determined by the system parameters, essentially the
approximate frequency :math:`\sqrt{s'(0)/m}` for linear :math:`s` and small damping,
and one period dictated by :math:`F(t)` in case the excitation is periodic.
This is, however,
nothing that the program can depend on or make use of.
Therefore, the user has to specify :math:`T` and the window width
to get a plot that moves with the graph and shows
the most recent parts of it in long time simulations.

The ``vib.py`` code
contains several functions for analyzing the time series signal
and for visualizing the solutions.

.. _vib:ode2:ui:

User interface
--------------

.. index:: ArgumentParser (Python class)

.. index:: argparse (Python module)

The ``main`` function is changed substantially from
the ``vib_undamped.py`` code, since we need to
specify the new data :math:`c`, :math:`s(u)`, and :math:`F(t)`.  In addition, we must
set :math:`T` and the plot window width (instead of the number of periods we
want to simulate as in ``vib_undamped.py``). To figure out whether we
can use one plot for the whole time series or if we should follow the
most recent part of :math:`u`, we can use the ``plot_empricial_freq_and_amplitude``
function's estimate of the number of local maxima. This number is now
returned from the function and used in ``main`` to decide on the
visualization technique.

The Euler-Cromer scheme for the generalized model
-------------------------------------------------

The ideas of the Euler-Cromer method from the section :ref:`vib:model2x2:EulerCromer`
carry over to the generalized model. We write :ref:`(58) <Eq:vib:ode2>`
as two equations for :math:`u` and :math:`v=u^{\prime}`. The first equation is taken as the
one with :math:`v'` on the left-hand side:

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:EulerCromer:veq:

.. math::

    \tag{73}
    v' = \frac{1}{m}(F(t)-s(u)-f(v)),
        
        

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:EulerCromer:ueq:

.. math::

    \tag{74}
    u^{\prime} = v{\thinspace .}
        
        

The idea is to step :ref:`(73) <Eq:vib:ode2:EulerCromer:veq>` forward using
a standard Forward Euler method, while we update :math:`u` from
:ref:`(74) <Eq:vib:ode2:EulerCromer:ueq>` with a Backward Euler method,
utilizing the recent, computed :math:`v^{n+1}` value. In detail,

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:EulerCromer:dveq0a:

.. math::

    \tag{75}
    \frac{v^{n+1}-v^n}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{m}(F(t_n)-s(u^n)-f(v^n)),
        
        

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:EulerCromer:dueq0a:

.. math::

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:EulerCromer:dveq:

.. math::

    \tag{77}
    v^{n+1} = v^n + \Delta t\frac{1}{m}(F(t_n)-s(u^n)-f(v^n)),

.. math::

    \tag{78}
    u^{n+1} = u^n + \Delta t\,v^{n+1}{\thinspace .}
        
        

We immediately note one very favorable feature of this scheme: all the
nonlinearities in :math:`s(u)` and :math:`f(v)` are evaluated at a previous time
level. This makes the Euler-Cromer method easier to apply and
hence much more convenient than the centered scheme for the second-order
ODE :ref:`(58) <Eq:vib:ode2>`.

Problem 1: Use linear/quadratic functions for verification
----------------------------------------------------------

Consider the ODE problem

.. math::
         u^{\prime\prime} + \omega^2u=f(t), \quad u(0)=I,\ u^{\prime}(0)=V,\ t\in(0,T]{\thinspace .}

Discretize this equation according to
:math:`[D_tD_t u + \omega^2 u = f]^n`.

**a)**
Derive the equation for the
first time step (:math:`u^1`).

**b)**
For verification purposes,
we use the method of manufactured solutions (MMS) with the
choice of :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(x,t)= ct+d`.
Find restrictions on :math:`c` and :math:`d` from
the initial conditions. Compute the corresponding source term :math:`f` by term.
Show that :math:`[D_tD_t t]^n=0` and use the fact
that the :math:`D_tD_t` operator is linear,
:math:`[D_tD_t (ct+d)]^n = c[D_tD_t t]^n + [D_tD_t d]^n = 0`, to show that
:math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}` is also a perfect solution of the discrete equations.

**c)**
Use ``sympy`` to do the symbolic calculations above. Here is a
sketch of the program ``vib_undamped_verify_mms.py``:

.. code-block:: python

        import sympy as sym
        V, t, I, w, dt = sym.symbols('V t I w dt')  # global symbols
        f = None  # global variable for the source term in the ODE
        
        def ode_source_term(u):
            """Return the terms in the ODE that the source term
            must balance, here u'' + w**2*u.
            u is symbolic Python function of t."""
            return sym.diff(u(t), t, t) + w**2*u(t)
        
        def residual_discrete_eq(u):
            """Return the residual of the discrete eq. with u inserted."""
            R = ...
            return sym.simplify(R)
        
        def residual_discrete_eq_step1(u):
            """Return the residual of the discrete eq. at the first
            step with u inserted."""
            R = ...
            return sym.simplify(R)
        
        def DtDt(u, dt):
            """Return 2nd-order finite difference for u_tt.
            u is a symbolic Python function of t.

        def main(u):
            """
            Given some chosen solution u (as a function of t, implemented

            the discrete equations.

            global f  # source term in the ODE

            # Residual in discrete equations (should be 0)
            print 'residual step1:', residual_discrete_eq_step1(u)
            print 'residual:', residual_discrete_eq(u)
        
        def linear():

            linear()

Fill in the various functions such that the calls in the ``main``
function works.

**d)**
The purpose now is to choose a quadratic function
:math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}} = bt^2 + ct + d` as exact solution. Extend the ``sympy``
code above with a function ``quadratic`` for fitting ``f`` and checking
if the discrete equations are fulfilled. (The function is very similar
to ``linear``.)

.. Check with hand calculations that the ``sympy`` implementation

.. is correct.

**e)**
Will a polynomial of degree three fulfill the discrete equations?

**f)**
Implement a ``solver`` function for computing the numerical
solution of this problem.

**g)**
Write a nose test for checking that the quadratic solution
is computed to correctly (too machine precision, but the
round-off errors accumulate and increase with :math:`T`) by the ``solver``
function.

Exercise 2: Show linear growth of the phase with time
-----------------------------------------------------

Consider an exact solution :math:`I\cos (\omega t)` and an
approximation :math:`I\cos(\tilde\omega t)`.
Define the phase error as time lag between the peak :math:`I`
in the exact solution and the corresponding peak in the approximation
after :math:`m` periods of oscillations. Show that this phase error
is linear in :math:`m`.

.. _vib:exer:w:adjust:

Exercise 3: Improve the accuracy by adjusting the frequency
-----------------------------------------------------------

According to :ref:`(19) <Eq:vib:ode1:tildeomega:series>`, the numerical
frequency deviates from the exact frequency by a (dominating) amount
:math:`\omega^3\Delta t^2/24 >0`. Replace the ``w`` parameter in the algorithm
in the ``solver`` function in ``vib_undamped.py`` by ``w*(1 -
(1./24)*w**2*dt**2`` and test how this adjustment in the numerical
algorithm improves the accuracy (use :math:`\Delta t =0.1` and simulate
for 80 periods, with and without adjustment of :math:`\omega`).

.. --- begin exercise ---

.. _vib:exer:undamped:adaptive:

Exercise 4: See if adaptive methods improve the phase error
-----------------------------------------------------------

Adaptive methods for solving ODEs aim at adjusting :math:`\Delta t` such
that the error is within a user-prescribed tolerance. Implement the
equation :math:`u^{\prime\prime}+u=0` in the `Odespy <https://github.com/hplgit/odespy>`__
software. Use the example `on adaptive
schemes <http://hplgit.github.io/decay-book/doc/pub/book/sphinx/._book006.html#example-adaptive-runge-kutta-methods>`__
in [Ref2]_.  Run the scheme with a very low
tolerance (say :math:`10^{-14}`) and for a long time, check the number of
time points in the solver's mesh (``len(solver.t_all)``), and compare
the phase error with that produced by the simple finite difference
method from the section :ref:`vib:ode1:fdm` with the same number of (equally
spaced) mesh points. The question is whether it pays off to use an
adaptive solver or if equally many points with a simple method gives
about the same accuracy.

Exercise 5: Use a Taylor polynomial to compute :math:`u^1`
----------------------------------------------------------

As an alternative to the derivation of :ref:`(8) <Eq:vib:ode1:step4b>` for
computing :math:`u^1`, one can use a Taylor polynomial with three terms
for :math:`u^1`:

.. math::
         u(t_1) \approx u(0) + u^{\prime}(0)\Delta t + {\frac{1}{2}}u^{\prime\prime}(0)\Delta t^2

With :math:`u^{\prime\prime}=-\omega^2 u` and :math:`u^{\prime}(0)=0`, show that this method also leads to
:ref:`(8) <Eq:vib:ode1:step4b>`. Generalize the condition on :math:`u^{\prime}(0)` to
be :math:`u^{\prime}(0)=V` and compute :math:`u^1` in this case with both methods.

Exercise 6: Find the minimal resolution of an oscillatory function
------------------------------------------------------------------

.. Short: Find the largest relevant value of :math:`\omega\Delta t`

Sketch the function on a given mesh which has the highest possible
frequency. That is, this oscillatory "cos-like" function has its
maxima and minima at every two grid points.  Find an expression for
the frequency of this function, and use the result to find the largest
relevant value of :math:`\omega\Delta t` when :math:`\omega` is the frequency
of an oscillating function and :math:`\Delta t` is the mesh spacing.

.. _vib:exer:fd:exp:plot:

Exercise 7: Visualize the accuracy of finite differences for a cosine function
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. Short: Visualize the accuracy of finite differences

We introduce the error fraction

.. math::
         E = \frac{[D_tD_t u]^n}{u^{\prime\prime}(t_n)} 

to measure the error in the finite difference approximation :math:`D_tD_tu` to
:math:`u^{\prime\prime}`.
Compute :math:`E`
for the specific choice of a cosine/sine function of the
form :math:`u=\exp{(i\omega t)}` and show that

.. math::
         E = \left(\frac{2}{\omega\Delta t}\right)^2
        \sin^2(\frac{\omega\Delta t}{2})
        {\thinspace .}
        

Plot :math:`E` as a function of :math:`p=\omega\Delta t`. The relevant
values of :math:`p` are :math:`[0,\pi]` (see :ref:`vib:exer:wdt:limit`
for why :math:`p>\pi` does not make sense).
The deviation of the curve from unity visualizes the error in the
approximation. Also expand :math:`E` as a Taylor polynomial in :math:`p` up to
fourth degree (use, e.g., ``sympy``).

.. _vib:exer:energy:convrate:

Exercise 8: Verify convergence rates of the error in energy
-----------------------------------------------------------

We consider the ODE problem :math:`u^{\prime\prime} + \omega^2u=0`, :math:`u(0)=I`, :math:`u^{\prime}(0)=V`,
for :math:`t\in (0,T]`. The total energy of the solution
:math:`E(t)=\frac{1}{2}(u^{\prime})^2 + \frac{1}{2}\omega^2 u^2` should stay
constant.
The error in energy can be computed as explained in
the section :ref:`vib:model1:energy`.

Make a nose test in a file ``test_error_conv.py``, where code from
``vib_undamped.py`` is imported, but the ``convergence_rates`` and
``test_convergence_rates`` functions are copied and modified to also
incorporate computations of the error in energy and the convergence
rate of this error. The expected rate is 2.

-----------------------------------------------------------

This exercise is a generalization of :ref:`vib:exer:undamped:verify:linquad` to the extended model problem
:ref:`(58) <Eq:vib:ode2>` where the damping term is either linear or quadratic.
Solve the various subproblems and see how the results and problem
settings change with the generalized ODE in case of linear or
quadratic damping. By modifying the code from :ref:`vib:exer:undamped:verify:linquad`, ``sympy`` will do most
of the work required to analyze the generalized problem.

Find the complete analytical solution to the problem in this case

the various elements you need to write down the exact solution).

``amplitudes`` function in the ``vib_undamped.py`` file (see the section :ref:`vib:ode1:empirical`) to investigate how well famous methods for
1st-order ODEs can preserve the amplitude of :math:`u` in undamped
oscillations.  Test, for example, the 3rd- and 4th-order Runge-Kutta
methods (``RK3``, ``RK4``), the Crank-Nicolson method (``CrankNicolson``),
the 2nd- and 3rd-order Adams-Bashforth methods (``AdamsBashforth2``,

Exercise 16: Use a backward difference for the damping term
-----------------------------------------------------------

As an alternative to discretizing the damping terms :math:`\beta u^{\prime}` and
:math:`\beta |u^{\prime}|u^{\prime}` by centered differences, we may apply
backward differences:

.. math::
        
        [u^{\prime}]^n &\approx [D_t^-u]^n,\\ 
        & [|u^{\prime}|u^{\prime}]^n &\approx [|D_t^-u|D_t^-u]^n
        = |[D_t^-u]^n|[D_t^-u]^n{\thinspace .}
        

The advantage of the backward difference is that the damping term is
evaluated using known values :math:`u^n` and :math:`u^{n-1}` only.
Extend the `vib.py <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/vib/vib.py>`__ code with a scheme based
