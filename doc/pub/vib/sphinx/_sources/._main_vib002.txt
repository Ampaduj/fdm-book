Generalization: damping, nonlinearities, and excitation
=======================================================

.. index:: nonlinear restoring force

.. index:: nonlinear spring

.. index:: forced vibrations

We shall now generalize the simple model problem from
the section :ref:`vib:model1` to include a possibly nonlinear damping term :math:`f(u^{\prime})`,
a possibly nonlinear spring (or restoring) force :math:`s(u)`, and
some external excitation :math:`F(t)`:

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:

.. math::

    \tag{71}
    mu^{\prime\prime} + f(u^{\prime}) + s(u) = F(t),\quad u(0)=I,\ u^{\prime}(0)=V,\ t\in (0,T]
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

We have also included a possibly nonzero initial value for :math:`u^{\prime}(0)`.
The parameters :math:`m`, :math:`f(u^{\prime})`, :math:`s(u)`, :math:`F(t)`, :math:`I`, :math:`V`, and :math:`T` are
input data.

There are two main types of damping (friction) forces: linear :math:`f(u^{\prime})=bu`, or
quadratic :math:`f(u^{\prime})=bu^{\prime}|u^{\prime}|`. Spring systems often feature linear
damping, while air resistance usually gives rise to quadratic damping.
Spring forces are often linear: :math:`s(u)=cu`, but nonlinear versions
are also common, the most famous is the gravity force on a pendulum
that acts as a spring with :math:`s(u)\sim \sin(u)`.

A centered scheme for linear damping
------------------------------------

Sampling :ref:`(71) <Eq:vib:ode2>` at a mesh point :math:`t_n`, replacing
:math:`u^{\prime\prime}(t_n)` by :math:`[D_tD_tu]^n`, and :math:`u^{\prime}(t_n)` by :math:`[D_{2t}u]^n` results
in the discretization

.. _Eq:_auto32:

.. math::

    \tag{72}
    [mD_tD_t u + f(D_{2t}u) + s(u) = F]^n,
        
        

which written out means

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:step3b:

.. math::

    \tag{73}
    m\frac{u^{n+1}-2u^n + u^{n-1}}{\Delta t^2}
        + f(\frac{u^{n+1}-u^{n-1}}{2\Delta t}) + s(u^n) = F^n,
        
        

where :math:`F^n` as usual means :math:`F(t)` evaluated at :math:`t=t_n`.
Solving :ref:`(73) <Eq:vib:ode2:step3b>` with respect to the unknown
:math:`u^{n+1}` gives a problem: the :math:`u^{n+1}` inside the :math:`f` function
makes the equation *nonlinear* unless :math:`f(u^{\prime})` is a linear function,
:math:`f(u^{\prime})=bu^{\prime}`. For now we shall assume that :math:`f` is linear in :math:`u^{\prime}`.
Then

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:step3b2:

.. math::

    \tag{74}
    m\frac{u^{n+1}-2u^n + u^{n-1}}{\Delta t^2}
        + b\frac{u^{n+1}-u^{n-1}}{2\Delta t} + s(u^n) = F^n,
        
        

which gives an explicit formula for :math:`u` at each
new time level:

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:step4:

.. math::

    \tag{75}
    u^{n+1} = (2mu^n + (\frac{b}{2}\Delta t - m)u^{n-1} +
        \Delta t^2(F^n - s(u^n)))(m + \frac{b}{2}\Delta t)^{-1}
        
        {\thinspace .}
        

For the first time step we need to discretize :math:`u^{\prime}(0)=V`
as :math:`[D_{2t}u = V]^0` and combine
with :ref:`(75) <Eq:vib:ode2:step4>` for :math:`n=0`. The discretized initial condition
leads to

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:ic:du:

.. math::

    \tag{76}
    u^{-1} = u^{1} - 2\Delta t V,
        
        

which inserted in :ref:`(75) <Eq:vib:ode2:step4>` for :math:`n=0` gives an equation
that can be solved for
:math:`u^1`:

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:step4b:

.. math::

    \tag{77}
    u^1 = u^0 + \Delta t\, V
        + \frac{\Delta t^2}{2m}(-bV - s(u^0) + F^0)
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

.. _vib:ode2:fdm:fquad:

A centered scheme for quadratic damping
---------------------------------------

When :math:`f(u^{\prime})=bu^{\prime}|u^{\prime}|`, we get a quadratic equation for :math:`u^{n+1}`
in :ref:`(73) <Eq:vib:ode2:step3b>`. This equation can be straightforwardly
solved by the well-known formula for the roots of a quadratic equation.
However, we can also avoid the nonlinearity by introducing
an approximation with an error of order no higher than what we
already have from replacing derivatives with finite differences.

.. index:: geometric mean

.. index::
   single: averaging; geometric

We start with :ref:`(71) <Eq:vib:ode2>` and only replace
:math:`u^{\prime\prime}` by :math:`D_tD_tu`, resulting in

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:quad:idea1:

.. math::

    \tag{78}
    [mD_tD_t u + bu^{\prime}|u^{\prime}| + s(u) = F]^n{\thinspace .}
        
        

Here, :math:`u^{\prime}|u^{\prime}|` is to be computed at time :math:`t_n`. The idea
is now to introduce
a *geometric mean*, defined by

.. math::
         (w^2)^n \approx w^{n-\frac{1}{2}}w^{n+\frac{1}{2}},

for some quantity :math:`w` depending on time. The error in the geometric mean
approximation is :math:`{\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^2)}`, the same as in the
approximation :math:`u^{\prime\prime}\approx D_tD_tu`. With :math:`w=u^{\prime}` it follows
that

.. math::
         [u^{\prime}|u^{\prime}|]^n \approx u^{\prime}(t_{n+\frac{1}{2}})|u^{\prime}(t_{n-\frac{1}{2}})|{\thinspace .}

The next step is to approximate
:math:`u^{\prime}` at :math:`t_{n\pm 1/2}`, and fortunately a centered difference
fits perfectly into the formulas since it involves :math:`u` values at
the mesh points only. With the approximations

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:quad:idea2:

.. math::

    \tag{79}
    u^{\prime}(t_{n+1/2})\approx [D_t u]^{n+\frac{1}{2}},\quad u^{\prime}(t_{n-1/2})\approx [D_t u]^{n-\frac{1}{2}},
        
        

we get

.. _Eq:_auto33:

.. math::

    \tag{80}
    [u^{\prime}|u^{\prime}|]^n
        \approx [D_tu]^{n+\frac{1}{2}}|[D_tu]^{n-\frac{1}{2}}| = \frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{\Delta t}
        \frac{|u^n-u^{n-1}|}{\Delta t}
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

The counterpart to :ref:`(73) <Eq:vib:ode2:step3b>` is then

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:step3b:quad:

.. math::

    \tag{81}
    m\frac{u^{n+1}-2u^n + u^{n-1}}{\Delta t^2}
        + b\frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{\Delta t}\frac{|u^n-u^{n-1}|}{\Delta t}
        + s(u^n) = F^n,
        
        

which is linear in the unknown :math:`u^{n+1}`. Therefore, we can easily solve
:ref:`(81) <Eq:vib:ode2:step3b:quad>`
with respect to :math:`u^{n+1}` and achieve the explicit updating formula

.. math::
        
        u^{n+1} =  \left( m + b|u^n-u^{n-1}|\right)^{-1}\times \nonumber
        

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:step4:quad:

.. math::

    \tag{82}
    \qquad \left(2m u^n - mu^{n-1} + bu^n|u^n-u^{n-1}| + \Delta t^2 (F^n - s(u^n))
        \right)
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

.. Make exercise to solve complicated u^1 equation with Bisection/Newton

In the derivation of a special equation for the first
time step we run into some trouble: inserting :ref:`(76) <Eq:vib:ode2:ic:du>`
in :ref:`(82) <Eq:vib:ode2:step4:quad>` for :math:`n=0` results in a complicated nonlinear
equation for :math:`u^1`. By thinking differently about the problem we can
easily get away with the nonlinearity again. We have for :math:`n=0` that
:math:`b[u^{\prime}|u^{\prime}|]^0 = bV|V|`. Using this value in :ref:`(78) <Eq:vib:ode2:quad:idea1>`
gives

.. _Eq:_auto34:

.. math::

    \tag{83}
    [mD_tD_t u + bV|V| + s(u) = F]^0
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

Writing this equation out and using :ref:`(76) <Eq:vib:ode2:ic:du>` results in the
special equation for the first time step:

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:step4b:quad:

.. math::

    \tag{84}
    u^1 = u^0 + \Delta t V + \frac{\Delta t^2}{2m}\left(-bV|V| - s(u^0) + F^0\right)
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

A forward-backward discretization of the quadratic damping term
---------------------------------------------------------------

The previous section first proposed to discretize the quadratic
damping term :math:`|u^{\prime}|u^{\prime}` using centered differences:
:math:`[|D_{2t}|D_{2t}u]^n`. As this gives rise to a nonlinearity in
:math:`u^{n+1}`, it was instead proposed to use a geometric mean combined
with centered differences.  But there are other alternatives. To get
rid of the nonlinearity in :math:`[|D_{2t}|D_{2t}u]^n`, one can think
differently: apply a backward difference to :math:`|u^{\prime}|`, such that
the term involves known values, and apply a forward difference to
:math:`u^{\prime}` to make the term linear in the unknown :math:`u^{n+1}`. With
mathematics,

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:nonlin:fbdiff:

.. math::

    \tag{85}
    [\beta |u^{\prime}|u^{\prime}]^n \approx \beta |[D_t^-u]^n|[D_t^+ u]^n =
        \beta\left\vert\frac{u^n-u^{n-1}}{\Delta t}\right\vert
        \frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{\Delta t}{\thinspace .}
        
        

The forward and backward differences both have an error proportional
to :math:`\Delta t` so one may think the discretization above leads to
a first-order scheme.
However, by looking at the formulas, we realize that the forward-backward
differences in :ref:`(85) <Eq:vib:ode2:nonlin:fbdiff>`
result in exactly the same scheme as in
:ref:`(81) <Eq:vib:ode2:step3b:quad>` where we
used a geometric mean and centered differences and committed errors
of size :math:`{\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^2)}`. Therefore, the forward-backward
differences in :ref:`(85) <Eq:vib:ode2:nonlin:fbdiff>`
act in a symmetric way and actually produce a second-order
accurate discretization of the quadratic damping term.

.. _vib:ode2:solver:

Implementation          (3)
---------------------------

.. index:: vib.py

The algorithm arising from the methods in the sections :ref:`vib:ode2:fdm:flin`
and :ref:`vib:ode2:fdm:fquad` is very similar to the undamped case in
the section :ref:`vib:ode1:fdm`. The difference is
basically a question of different formulas for :math:`u^1` and
:math:`u^{n+1}`. This is actually quite remarkable. The equation
:ref:`(71) <Eq:vib:ode2>` is normally impossible to solve by pen and paper, but
possible for some special choices of :math:`F`, :math:`s`, and :math:`f`. On the
contrary, the complexity of the
nonlinear generalized model :ref:`(71) <Eq:vib:ode2>` versus the
simple undamped model is not a big deal when we solve the
problem numerically!

The computational algorithm takes the form

 1. :math:`u^0=I`

 2. compute :math:`u^1` from :ref:`(77) <Eq:vib:ode2:step4b>` if linear
    damping or :ref:`(84) <Eq:vib:ode2:step4b:quad>` if quadratic damping

 3. for :math:`n=1,2,\ldots,N_t-1`:

   a. compute :math:`u^{n+1}` from :ref:`(75) <Eq:vib:ode2:step4>` if linear
      damping or :ref:`(82) <Eq:vib:ode2:step4:quad>` if quadratic damping

Modifying the ``solver`` function for the undamped case is fairly
easy, the big difference being many more terms and if tests on
the type of damping:

.. code-block:: python

    def solver(I, V, m, b, s, F, dt, T, damping='linear'):
        """
        Solve m*u'' + f(u') + s(u) = F(t) for t in (0,T],
        u(0)=I and u'(0)=V,
        by a central finite difference method with time step dt.
        If damping is 'linear', f(u')=b*u, while if damping is
        'quadratic', f(u')=b*u'*abs(u').
        F(t) and s(u) are Python functions.
        """
        dt = float(dt); b = float(b); m = float(m) # avoid integer div.
        Nt = int(round(T/dt))
        u = np.zeros(Nt+1)
        t = np.linspace(0, Nt*dt, Nt+1)
    
        u[0] = I
        if damping == 'linear':
            u[1] = u[0] + dt*V + dt**2/(2*m)*(-b*V - s(u[0]) + F(t[0]))
        elif damping == 'quadratic':
            u[1] = u[0] + dt*V + \ 
                   dt**2/(2*m)*(-b*V*abs(V) - s(u[0]) + F(t[0]))
    
        for n in range(1, Nt):
            if damping == 'linear':
                u[n+1] = (2*m*u[n] + (b*dt/2 - m)*u[n-1] +
                          dt**2*(F(t[n]) - s(u[n])))/(m + b*dt/2)
            elif damping == 'quadratic':
                u[n+1] = (2*m*u[n] - m*u[n-1] + b*u[n]*abs(u[n] - u[n-1])
                          + dt**2*(F(t[n]) - s(u[n])))/\ 
                          (m + b*abs(u[n] - u[n-1]))
        return u, t

.. _vib:ode2:verify:

Verification          (3)
-------------------------

Constant solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For debugging and initial verification, a constant solution is often
very useful. We choose :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(t)=I`, which implies :math:`V=0`.
Inserted in the ODE, we get
:math:`F(t)=s(I)` for any choice of :math:`f`. Since the discrete derivative
of a constant vanishes (in particular, :math:`[D_{2t}I]^n=0`,
:math:`[D_tI]^n=0`, and :math:`[D_tD_t I]^n=0`), the constant solution also fulfills
the discrete equations. The constant should therefore be reproduced
to machine precision. The function ``test_constant`` in ``vib.py``
implements this test.

Linear solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we choose a linear solution: :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}} = ct + d`. The initial condition
:math:`u(0)=I` implies :math:`d=I`, and :math:`u^{\prime}(0)=V` forces :math:`c` to be :math:`V`.
Inserting :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}=Vt+I` in the ODE with linear damping results in

.. math::
         0 + bV + s(Vt+I) = F(t),

while quadratic damping requires the source term

.. math::
         0 + b|V|V + s(Vt+I) = F(t){\thinspace .}

Since the finite difference approximations used to compute :math:`u^{\prime}` all
are exact for a linear function, it turns out that the linear :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}`
is also a solution of the discrete equations.
:ref:`vib:exer:verify:gen:linear` asks you to carry out
all the details.

Quadratic solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Choosing :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}} = bt^2 + Vt + I`, with :math:`b` arbitrary,
fulfills the initial conditions and
fits the ODE if :math:`F` is adjusted properly. The solution also solves
the discrete equations with linear damping. However, this quadratic
polynomial in :math:`t` does not fulfill the discrete equations in case
of quadratic damping, because the geometric mean used in the approximation
of this term introduces an error.
Doing :ref:`vib:exer:verify:gen:linear` will reveal
the details. One can fit :math:`F^n` in the discrete equations such that
the quadratic polynomial is reproduced by the numerical method (to
machine precision).

Catching bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How good are the constant and quadratic solutions at catching
bugs in the implementation? Let us check that by introducing some bugs.

 * Use ``m`` instead of ``2*m`` in the denominator of ``u[1]``: code works for constant
   solution, but fails (as it should) for a quadratic one.

 * Use ``b*dt`` instead of ``b*dt/2`` in the updating formula for ``u[n+1]``
   in case of linear damping: constant and quadratic both fail.

 * Use ``F[n+1]`` instead of ``F[n]`` in case of linear or quadratic damping:
   constant solution works, quadratic fails.

We realize that the constant solution is very useful for catching certain bugs because
of its simplicity (easy to predict what the different terms in the
formula should evaluate to), while the quadratic solution seems
capable of detecting all (?) other kinds of typos in the scheme.
These results demonstrate why we focus so much on exact, simple polynomial
solutions of the numerical schemes in these writings.

Visualization
-------------

The functions for visualizations differ significantly from
those in the undamped case in the ``vib_undamped.py`` program because,
in the present general case, we do not have an exact solution to
include in the plots. Moreover, we have no good estimate of
the periods of the oscillations as there will be one period
determined by the system parameters, essentially the
approximate frequency :math:`\sqrt{s'(0)/m}` for linear :math:`s` and small damping,
and one period dictated by :math:`F(t)` in case the excitation is periodic.
This is, however,
nothing that the program can depend on or make use of.
Therefore, the user has to specify :math:`T` and the window width
to get a plot that moves with the graph and shows
the most recent parts of it in long time simulations.

The ``vib.py`` code
contains several functions for analyzing the time series signal
and for visualizing the solutions.

User interface
--------------

.. index:: ArgumentParser (Python class)

.. index:: argparse (Python module)

The ``main`` function is changed substantially from
the ``vib_undamped.py`` code, since we need to
specify the new data :math:`c`, :math:`s(u)`, and :math:`F(t)`.  In addition, we must
set :math:`T` and the plot window width (instead of the number of periods we
want to simulate as in ``vib_undamped.py``). To figure out whether we
can use one plot for the whole time series or if we should follow the
most recent part of :math:`u`, we can use the ``plot_empricial_freq_and_amplitude``
function's estimate of the number of local maxima. This number is now
returned from the function and used in ``main`` to decide on the
visualization technique.

The Euler-Cromer scheme for the generalized model
-------------------------------------------------

The ideas of the Euler-Cromer method from the section :ref:`vib:model2x2:EulerCromer`
carry over to the generalized model. We write :ref:`(71) <Eq:vib:ode2>`
as two equations for :math:`u` and :math:`v=u^{\prime}`. The first equation is taken as the
one with :math:`v^{\prime}` on the left-hand side:

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:EulerCromer:veq:

    \tag{86}
    v^{\prime} = \frac{1}{m}(F(t)-s(u)-f(v)),

.. math::

Again, the idea is to step :ref:`(86) <Eq:vib:ode2:EulerCromer:veq>` forward using
a standard Forward Euler method, while we update :math:`u` from
:ref:`(87) <Eq:vib:ode2:EulerCromer:ueq>` with a Backward Euler method,
utilizing the recent, computed :math:`v^{n+1}` value. In detail,

resulting in the explicit scheme

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:EulerCromer:dveq:

.. math::

    \tag{90}
    v^{n+1} = v^n + \Delta t\frac{1}{m}(F(t_n)-s(u^n)-f(v^n)),

    \tag{91}
    u^{n+1} = u^n + \Delta t\,v^{n+1}{\thinspace .}
        
        

We immediately note one very favorable feature of this scheme: all the
nonlinearities in :math:`s(u)` and :math:`f(v)` are evaluated at a previous time
level. This makes the Euler-Cromer method easier to apply and
hence much more convenient than the centered scheme for the second-order
ODE :ref:`(71) <Eq:vib:ode2>`.

The initial conditions are trivially set as

The Stoermer-Verlet algorithm for the generalized model
-------------------------------------------------------

We can easily apply the ideas from the section :ref:`vib:model2x2:StormerVerlet` to
extend that method to the generalized model

.. math::
        
        v^{\prime} &= \frac{1}{m}(F(t)-s(u)-f(v)),\\ 
        u^{\prime} &= v{\thinspace .}
        

However, since the scheme is essentially centered differences for
the ODE system on a staggered mesh, we do not go into detail here,
but refer to the section :ref:`vib:ode2:staggered`.

.. _vib:ode2:staggered:

A staggered Euler-Cromer scheme for a generalized model
-------------------------------------------------------

The more general model for vibration problems,

.. _Eq:_auto37:

.. math::

    \tag{94}
    mu'' + f(u') + s(u) = F(t),\quad u(0)=I,\ u'(0)=V,\ t\in (0,T],
        
        

can be rewritten as a first-order ODE system

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:veq:

.. math::

    \tag{95}
    v' = m^{-1}\left(F(t) - f(v) - s(u)\right),
        
        

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:ueq:

.. math::

    \tag{96}
    u' = v{\thinspace .}
        
        

It is natural to introduce a staggered mesh (see the section :ref:`vib:model2x2:staggered`) and seek :math:`u` at mesh points :math:`t_n` (the numerical value is
denoted by :math:`u^n`) and :math:`v` between mesh points at :math:`t_{n+1/2}` (the numerical
value is denoted by :math:`v^{n+\frac{1}{2}}`).
A centered difference approximation to :ref:`(96) <Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:ueq>`-:ref:`(95) <Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:veq>` can then be written in operator notation as

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:dveq:

.. math::

    \tag{97}
    \lbrack D_tv = m^{-1}\left(F(t) - f(v) - s(u)\right)\rbrack^n,
        
        

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:dueq:

.. math::

    \tag{98}
    \lbrack D_t u = v\rbrack^{n+\frac{1}{2}}{\thinspace .}
        
        

Written out,

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:dveq2:

.. math::

    \tag{99}
    \frac{v^{n+\frac{1}{2}} - v^{n-\frac{1}{2}}}{\Delta t}
        = m^{-1}\left(F^n - f(v^n) - s(u^n)\right),
        
        

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:dueq2:

.. math::

    \tag{100}
    \frac{u^n - u^{n-1}}{\Delta t} = v^{n+\frac{1}{2}}{\thinspace .}
        
        

With linear damping, :math:`f(v)=bv`, we can use an arithmetic mean
for :math:`f(v^n)`: :math:`f(v^n)\approx = \frac{1}{2}(f(v^{n-\frac{1}{2}}) +
f(v^{n+\frac{1}{2}}))`. The system
:ref:`(99) <Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:dveq2>`-:ref:`(100) <Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:dueq2>`
can then be solved with respect to the unknowns :math:`u^n` and :math:`v^{n+\frac{1}{2}}`:

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:v:scheme:lin:

.. math::

    \tag{101}
    v^{n+\frac{1}{2}} = \left(1 + \frac{b}{2m}\Delta t\right)^{-1}\left(
        v^{n-\frac{1}{2}} + {\Delta t}
        m^{-1}\left(F^n - {\frac{1}{2}}f(v^{n-\frac{1}{2}}) - s(u^n)\right)\right),
        
        

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:u:scheme:lin:

.. math::

    \tag{102}
    u^n  = u^{n-1} + {\Delta t}v^{n-\frac{1}{2}}{\thinspace .}
        
        

In case of quadratic damping, :math:`f(v)=b|v|v`, we can use a geometric mean:
:math:`f(v^n)\approx b|v^{n-\frac{1}{2}}|v^{n+\frac{1}{2}}`. Inserting this approximation
in :ref:`(99) <Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:dveq2>`-:ref:`(100) <Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:dueq2>` and
solving for the unknowns :math:`u^n` and :math:`v^{n+\frac{1}{2}}` results in

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:v:scheme:quad:

.. math::

    \tag{103}
    v^{n+\frac{1}{2}} = (1 + \frac{b}{m}|v^{n-\frac{1}{2}}|\Delta t)^{-1}\left(

        m^{-1}\left(F^n - s(u^n)\right)\right),

A variant of the Euler-Cromer type of algorithm, which provides an
error :math:`{\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^4)}` if :math:`f(v)=0`, is called PEFRL
[Ref4]_. This algorithm is very well suited for integrating
dynamic systems (especially those without damping) over very long time

Problem 20: Use a backward difference for the damping term
----------------------------------------------------------

As an alternative to discretizing the damping terms :math:`\beta u^{\prime}` and
:math:`\beta |u^{\prime}|u^{\prime}` by centered differences, we may apply
backward differences:

.. math::
        
        [u^{\prime}]^n &\approx [D_t^-u]^n,\\ 
        & [|u^{\prime}|u^{\prime}]^n\\

        &= |[D_t^-u]^n|[D_t^-u]^n{\thinspace .}
        

The advantage of the backward difference is that the damping term is
evaluated using known values :math:`u^n` and :math:`u^{n-1}` only.

.. _vib:exer:quad:damping:fwbw:

Exercise 21: Use the forward-backward scheme with quadratic damping
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We consider the generalized model with quadratic damping, expressed
as a system of two first-order equations as in the section :ref:`vib:ode2:staggered`:

.. math::
        
        u^{\prime} &= v,\\ 
        v' &= \frac{1}{m}\left( F(t) - \beta |v|v - s(u)\right){\thinspace .}
        

However, contrary to what is done in the section :ref:`vib:ode2:staggered`,
we want to apply the idea of a forward-backward discretization:
:math:`u` is marched forward by a one-sided Forward Euler scheme applied
to the first equation, and
thereafter :math:`v` can be marched forward by a Backward Euler scheme in the
second
equation.
Express the idea in operator notation and write out the
scheme. Unfortunately, the backward difference for the :math:`v` equation
creates a nonlinearity :math:`|v^{n+1}|v^{n+1}`.  To linearize this
nonlinearity, use the known value :math:`v^n` inside the absolute value
factor, i.e., :math:`|v^{n+1}|v^{n+1}\approx |v^n|v^{n+1}`.  Show that the
resulting scheme is equivalent to the one in the section :ref:`vib:ode2:staggered` for some time level :math:`n\geq 1`.

What we learn from this exercise is that the first-order differences
and the linearization trick play together in "the right way" such that
the scheme is as good as when we (in the section :ref:`vib:ode2:staggered`)
carefully apply centered differences and a geometric mean on a
staggered mesh to achieve second-order accuracy.

Applications of vibration models
================================

The following text derives some of the most well-known physical
problems that lead to second-order ODE models of the type addressed in
this document.  We consider a simple spring-mass system; thereafter
extended with nonlinear spring, damping, and external excitation; a
spring-mass system with sliding friction; a simple and a physical
(classical) pendulum; and an elastic pendulum.

.. _vib:app:mass_spring:

Oscillating mass attached to a spring
-------------------------------------

.. _vib:app:mass_spring:fig:

.. figure:: oscillator_spring.png
   :width: 500

   *Simple oscillating mass*

The most fundamental mechanical vibration system is depicted in Figure
:ref:`vib:app:mass_spring:fig`. A body with mass :math:`m` is attached to a
spring and can move horizontally without friction (in the wheels). The
position of the body is given by the vector :math:`\boldsymbol{r}(t) = u(t)\boldsymbol{i}`, where
:math:`\boldsymbol{i}` is a unit vector in :math:`x` direction.
There is
only one force acting on the body: a spring force :math:`\boldsymbol{F}_s =-ku\boldsymbol{i}`, where
:math:`k` is a constant. The point :math:`x=0`, where :math:`u=0`, must therefore
correspond to the body's position
where the spring is neither extended nor compressed, so the force
vanishes.

The basic physical principle that governs the motion of the body is
Newton's second law of motion: :math:`\boldsymbol{F}=m\boldsymbol{a}`, where
:math:`\boldsymbol{F}` is the sum of forces on the body, :math:`m` is its mass, and :math:`\boldsymbol{a}=\ddot\boldsymbol{r}`
is the acceleration. We use the dot for differentiation with respect
to time, which is
usual in mechanics. Newton's second law simplifies here
to :math:`-\boldsymbol{F}_s=m\ddot u\boldsymbol{i}`, which translates to

.. math::
         -ku = m\ddot u{\thinspace .}

Two initial conditions are needed: :math:`u(0)=I`, :math:`\dot u(0)=V`.
The ODE problem is normally written as

.. _Eq:vib:app:mass_spring:eqx:

.. math::

    \tag{119}
    m\ddot u + ku = 0,\quad u(0)=I,\ \dot u(0)=V{\thinspace .}
        
        

It is
not uncommon to divide by :math:`m`
and introduce the frequency :math:`\omega = \sqrt{k/m}`:

.. _Eq:vib:app:mass_spring:equ:

.. math::

    \tag{120}
    \ddot u + \omega^2 u = 0,\quad u(0)=I,\  \dot u(0)=V{\thinspace .}
        
        

This is the model problem in the first part of this chapter, with the
small difference that we write the time derivative of :math:`u` with a dot
above, while we used :math:`u^{\prime}` and :math:`u^{\prime\prime}` in previous
parts of the document.

.. index:: DOF (degree of freedom)

Since only one scalar mathematical quantity, :math:`u(t)`, describes the
complete motion, we say that the mechanical system has one degree of freedom
(DOF).

Scaling          (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For numerical simulations it is very convenient to scale
:ref:`(120) <Eq:vib:app:mass_spring:equ>` and thereby get rid of the problem of
finding relevant values for all the parameters :math:`m`, :math:`k`, :math:`I`, and :math:`V`.
Since the amplitude of the oscillations are dictated by :math:`I` and :math:`V`
(or more precisely, :math:`V/\omega`), we scale :math:`u` by :math:`I` (or :math:`V/\omega` if
:math:`I=0`):

.. math::
         \bar u = \frac{u}{I},\quad \bar t = \frac{t}{t_c}{\thinspace .}

The time scale :math:`t_c` is normally chosen as the inverse period :math:`2\pi/\omega` or
angular frequency :math:`1/\omega`, most often as :math:`t_c=1/\omega`.
Inserting the dimensionless quantities :math:`\bar u` and :math:`\bar t` in
:ref:`(120) <Eq:vib:app:mass_spring:equ>` results in the scaled problem

.. math::
         \frac{d^2\bar u}{d\bar t^2} + \bar u = 0,\quad \bar u(0)=1,\ \frac{\bar u}{\bar t}(0)=\beta = \frac{V}{I\omega},

where :math:`\beta` is a dimensionless number. Any motion that starts from rest
(:math:`V=0`) is free of parameters in the scaled model!

The physics
~~~~~~~~~~~

The typical physics of the system in Figure
:ref:`vib:app:mass_spring:fig` can be described as follows.  Initially,
we displace the body to some position :math:`I`, say at rest (:math:`V=0`). After
releasing the body, the spring, which is extended, will act with a
force :math:`-kI\boldsymbol{i}` and pull the body to the left. This force causes an
acceleration and therefore increases velocity. The body passes the
point :math:`x=0`, where :math:`u=0`, and the spring will then be compressed and
act with a force :math:`kx\boldsymbol{i}` against the motion and cause retardation. At
some point, the motion stops and the velocity is zero, before the
spring force :math:`kx\boldsymbol{i}` has worked long enough to push the body in
positive direction. The result is that the body accelerates back and
forth. As long as there is no friction forces to damp the motion, the
oscillations will continue forever.

.. _vib:app:mass_gen:

General mechanical vibrating system
-----------------------------------

.. _vib:app:mass_gen:fig:

.. figure:: oscillator_general.png
   :width: 500

   *General oscillating system*

The mechanical system in Figure :ref:`vib:app:mass_spring:fig` can easily be
extended to the more general system in Figure :ref:`vib:app:mass_gen:fig`,
where the body is attached to a spring and a dashpot, and also subject
to an environmental force :math:`F(t)\boldsymbol{i}`. The system has still only one
degree of freedom since the body can only move back and forth parallel to
the :math:`x` axis. The spring force was linear, :math:`\boldsymbol{F}_s=-ku\boldsymbol{i}`,
in the section :ref:`vib:app:mass_spring`, but in more general cases it can
depend nonlinearly on the position. We therefore set :math:`\boldsymbol{F}_s=s(u)\boldsymbol{i}`.
The dashpot, which acts
as a damper, results in a force :math:`\boldsymbol{F}_d` that depends on the body's
velocity :math:`\dot u` and that always acts against the motion.
The mathematical model of the force is written :math:`\boldsymbol{F}_d =f(\dot u)\boldsymbol{i}`.
A positive :math:`\dot u` must result in a force acting in the positive :math:`x`
direction.
Finally, we have the external environmental force :math:`\boldsymbol{F}_e = F(t)\boldsymbol{i}`.

Newton's second law of motion now involves three forces:

.. math::
         F(t)\boldsymbol{i} - f(\dot u)\boldsymbol{i} - s(u)\boldsymbol{i} = m\ddot u \boldsymbol{i}{\thinspace .}

The common mathematical form of the ODE problem is

.. _Eq:vib:app:mass_gen:equ:

.. math::

    \tag{121}
    m\ddot u + f(\dot u) + s(u) = F(t),\quad u(0)=I,\ \dot u(0)=V{\thinspace .}
        
        

This is the generalized problem treated in the last part of the
present chapter, but with prime denoting the derivative instead of the dot.

The most common models for the spring and dashpot are linear: :math:`f(\dot u)
=b\dot u` with a constant :math:`b\geq 0`, and :math:`s(u)=ku` for a constant :math:`k`.

Scaling          (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A specific scaling requires specific choices of :math:`f`, :math:`s`, and :math:`F`.
Suppose we have

.. math::
         f(\dot u) = b|\dot u|\dot u,\quad s(u)=ku,\quad F(t)=A\sin(\phi t){\thinspace .}

We introduce dimensionless variables as usual, :math:`\bar u = u/u_c` and
:math:`\bar t = t/t_c`. The scale :math:`u_c` depends both on the initial conditions
and :math:`F`, but as time grows, the effect of the initial conditions die out
and :math:`F` will drive the motion. Inserting :math:`\bar u` and :math:`\bar t` in the
ODE gives

.. math::
         m\frac{u_c}{t_c^2}\frac{d^2\bar u}{d\bar t^2}
        + b\frac{u_c^2}{t_c^2}\left\vert\frac{d\bar u}{d\bar t}\right\vert
        \frac{d\bar u}{d\bar t} + ku_c\bar u = A\sin(\phi t_c\bar t){\thinspace .}

We divide by :math:`u_c/t_c^2` and demand the coefficients of the
:math:`\bar u` and the forcing term from :math:`F(t)` to have unit coefficients.
This leads to the scales

.. math::
         t_c = \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}},\quad u_c = \frac{A}{k}{\thinspace .}

The scaled ODE becomes

.. _Eq:vib:app:mass_gen:scaled:

.. math::

    \tag{122}
    \frac{d^2\bar u}{d\bar t^2}
        + 2\beta\left\vert\frac{d\bar u}{d\bar t}\right\vert
        \frac{d\bar u}{d\bar t} + \bar u = \sin(\gamma\bar t),
        
        

where there are two dimensionless numbers:

.. math::
         \beta = \frac{Ab}{2mk},\quad\gamma =\phi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}{\thinspace .}

The :math:`\beta` number measures the size of the damping term (relative to unity)
and is assumed to be small, basically because :math:`b` is small. The :math:`\phi`
number is the ratio of the time scale of free vibrations and the time scale
of the forcing.
The scaled initial conditions have two other dimensionless numbers

.. _vib:app:mass_sliding:

A sliding mass attached to a spring
-----------------------------------

Consider a variant of the oscillating body in the section :ref:`vib:app:mass_spring`
and Figure :ref:`vib:app:mass_spring:fig`: the body rests on a flat
surface, and there is sliding friction between the body and the surface.
Figure :ref:`vib:app:mass_sliding:fig` depicts the problem.

.. _vib:app:mass_sliding:fig:

.. figure:: oscillator_sliding.png
   :width: 500

   *Sketch of a body sliding on a surface*

The body is attached to a spring with spring force :math:`-s(u)\boldsymbol{i}`.
The friction force is proportional to the normal force on the surface,
:math:`-mg\boldsymbol{j}`, and given by :math:`-f(\dot u)\boldsymbol{i}`, where

.. math::
         f(\dot u) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        -\mu mg,& \dot u < 0,\\ 
        \mu mg, & \dot u > 0,\\ 
        0,      & \dot u=0
        \end{array}\right.

Here, :math:`\mu` is a friction coefficient. With the signum function

.. math::
         \mbox{sign(x)} = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        -1,& x < 0,\\ 
        1, & x > 0,\\ 
        0, & x=0
        \end{array}\right.

we can simply write :math:`f(\dot u) = \mu mg\,\hbox{sign}(\dot u)`
(the sign function is implemented by ``numpy.sign``).

The equation of motion becomes

.. _Eq:vib:app:mass_sliding:equ:

.. math::

    \tag{123}
    m\ddot u + \mu mg\hbox{sign}(\dot u) + s(u) = 0,\quad u(0)=I,\ \dot u(0)=V{\thinspace .}
        
        

.. _vib:app:washmach:

A jumping washing machine
-------------------------

A washing machine is placed on four springs with efficient dampers.
If the machine contains just a few clothes, the circular motion of
the machine induces a sinusoidal external force from the floor and the machine will
jump up and down if the frequency of the external force is close to
the natural frequency of the machine and its spring-damper system.

.. _vib:app:pendulum:

Motion of a pendulum
--------------------

Simple pendulum
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index::
   single: pendulum;  simple

A classical problem in mechanics is the motion of a pendulum. We first
consider a `simplified pendulum <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum>`__ (sometimes also called a
mathematical pendulum): a small body of mass :math:`m` is
attached to a massless wire and can oscillate back and forth in the
gravity field. Figure :ref:`vib:app:pendulum:fig_problem` shows a sketch
of the problem.

.. _vib:app:pendulum:fig_problem:

.. figure:: pendulum_problem.png
   :width: 300

   *Sketch of a simple pendulum*

The motion is governed by Newton's 2nd law, so we need to find
expressions for the forces and the acceleration. Three forces on the
body are considered: an unknown force :math:`S` from the wire, the gravity
force :math:`mg`, and an air resistance force, :math:`\frac{1}{2}C_D\varrho A|v|v`,
hereafter called the drag force, directed against the velocity
of the body. Here, :math:`C_D` is a drag coefficient, :math:`\varrho` is the
density of air, :math:`A` is the cross section area of the body, and :math:`v` is
the magnitude of the velocity.

We introduce a coordinate system with polar coordinates and unit
vectors :math:`{\boldsymbol{i}_r}` and :math:`\boldsymbol{i}_{\theta}` as shown in Figure
:ref:`vib:app:pendulum:fig_forces`.  The position of the center of mass
of the body is

.. math::
         \boldsymbol{r}(t) = x_0\boldsymbol{i} + y_0\boldsymbol{j} + L{\boldsymbol{i}_r},

where :math:`\boldsymbol{i}` and :math:`\boldsymbol{j}` are unit vectors in the corresponding Cartesian
coordinate system in the :math:`x` and :math:`y` directions, respectively. We have
that :math:`{\boldsymbol{i}_r} = \cos\theta\boldsymbol{i} +\sin\theta\boldsymbol{j}`.

.. _vib:app:pendulum:fig_forces:

.. figure:: pendulum_forces.png
   :width: 500

   *Forces acting on a simple pendulum*

The forces are now expressed as follows.

 * Wire force: :math:`-S{\boldsymbol{i}_r}`

 * Gravity force: :math:`-mg\boldsymbol{j} = mg(-\sin\theta\,\boldsymbol{i}_{\theta} + \cos\theta\,{\boldsymbol{i}_r})`

 * Drag force: :math:`-\frac{1}{2}C_D\varrho A |v|v\,\boldsymbol{i}_{\theta}`

Since a positive velocity means movement in the direction of :math:`\boldsymbol{i}_{\theta}`,
the drag force must be directed along :math:`-\boldsymbol{i}_{\theta}` so it works against the
motion. We assume motion in air so that the added mass effect can
be neglected (for a spherical body, the added mass is :math:`\frac{1}{2}\varrho V`,
where :math:`V` is the volume of the body). Also the buoyancy effect
can be neglected for motion in the air when the density difference
between the fluid and the body is so significant.

The velocity of the body is found from :math:`\boldsymbol{r}`:

.. math::
         \boldsymbol{v}(t) = \dot\boldsymbol{r} (t) = \frac{d}{d\theta}(x_0\boldsymbol{i} + y_0\boldsymbol{j} + L{\boldsymbol{i}_r})\frac{d\theta}{dt} = L\dot\theta\boldsymbol{i}_{\theta},

since :math:`\frac{d}{d\theta}{\boldsymbol{i}_r} = \boldsymbol{i}_{\theta}`. It follows that :math:`v=|\boldsymbol{v}|=L\dot\theta`.
The acceleration is

.. math::
         \boldsymbol{a}(t) = \dot\boldsymbol{v}(r) = \frac{d}{dt}(L\dot\theta\boldsymbol{i}_{\theta})
        = L\ddot\theta\boldsymbol{i}_{\theta} + L\dot\theta\frac{d\boldsymbol{i}_{\theta}}{d\theta}\dot\theta =
        = L\ddot\theta\boldsymbol{i}_{\theta} - L\dot\theta^2{\boldsymbol{i}_r},

since :math:`\frac{d}{d\theta}\boldsymbol{i}_{\theta} = -{\boldsymbol{i}_r}`.

Newton's 2nd law of motion becomes

.. math::
         -S{\boldsymbol{i}_r} + mg(-\sin\theta\,\boldsymbol{i}_{\theta} + \cos\theta\,{\boldsymbol{i}_r}) -
        \frac{1}{2}C_D\varrho AL^2|\dot\theta|\dot\theta\,\boldsymbol{i}_{\theta}
        = mL\ddot\theta\dot\theta\,\boldsymbol{i}_{\theta} - L\dot\theta^2{\boldsymbol{i}_r},

leading to two component equations

.. _Eq:vib:app:pendulum:ir:

.. math::

    \tag{124}
    -S + mg\cos\theta = -L\dot\theta^2,
        
        

.. _Eq:vib:app:pendulum:ith:

.. math::

    \tag{125}
    -mg\sin\theta - \frac{1}{2}C_D\varrho AL^2|\dot\theta|\dot\theta
        = mL\ddot\theta{\thinspace .}
        
        

From :ref:`(124) <Eq:vib:app:pendulum:ir>` we get an expression for
:math:`S=mg\cos\theta + L\dot\theta^2`, and from :ref:`(125) <Eq:vib:app:pendulum:ith>`
we get a differential equation for the angle :math:`\theta(t)`. This latter
equation is ordered as

.. _Eq:vib:app:pendulum:thetaeq:

.. math::

    \tag{126}
    m\ddot\theta + \frac{1}{2}C_D\varrho AL|\dot\theta|\dot\theta
        + \frac{mg}{L}\sin\theta = 0{\thinspace .}
        
        

Two initial conditions are needed: :math:`\theta=\Theta` and :math:`\dot\theta = \Omega`.
Normally, the pendulum motion is started from rest, which means :math:`\Omega =0`.

Equation :ref:`(126) <Eq:vib:app:pendulum:thetaeq>` fits the general model
used in :ref:`(71) <Eq:vib:ode2>` in the section :ref:`vib:model2` if we define
:math:`u=\theta`, :math:`f(u^{\prime}) = \frac{1}{2}C_D\varrho AL|\dot u|\dot u`,
:math:`s(u) = L^{-1}mg\sin u`, and :math:`F=0`.
If the body is a sphere with radius :math:`R`, we can take :math:`C_D=0.4` and :math:`A=\pi R^2`.
:ref:`vib:exer:pendulum_simple` asks you to scale the equations
and carry out specific simulations with this model.

Physical pendulum
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index::
   single: pendulum;  physical

The motion of a compound or physical pendulum where the wire is a rod with
mass, can be modeled very similarly. The governing equation is
:math:`I\boldsymbol{a} = \boldsymbol{T}` where :math:`I` is the moment of inertia of the entire body about
the point :math:`(x_0,y_0)`, and :math:`\boldsymbol{T}` is the sum of moments of the forces
with respect to :math:`(x_0,y_0)`. The vector equation reads

.. math::
         \boldsymbol{r}\times(-S{\boldsymbol{i}_r} + mg(-\sin\theta\boldsymbol{i}_{\theta} + \cos\theta{\boldsymbol{i}_r}) -
        \frac{1}{2}C_D\varrho AL^2|\dot\theta|\dot\theta\boldsymbol{i}_{\theta})
        = I(L\ddot\theta\dot\theta\boldsymbol{i}_{\theta} - L\dot\theta^2{\boldsymbol{i}_r}){\thinspace .}

The component equation in :math:`\boldsymbol{i}_{\theta}` direction gives the equation of motion
for :math:`\theta(t)`:

.. _Eq:vib:app:pendulum:thetaeq_physical:

.. math::

    \tag{127}
    I\ddot\theta + \frac{1}{2}C_D\varrho AL^3|\dot\theta|\dot\theta
        + mgL\sin\theta = 0{\thinspace .}

Dynamic free body diagram during pendulum motion
------------------------------------------------

.. index::
   single: free body diagram;  dynamic

.. index::
   single: free body diagram;  animated

.. index:: Pysketcher

Usually one plots the mathematical quantities as functions of time to
visualize the solution of ODE models.  :ref:`vib:exer:pendulum_simple` asks you to do this for the motion of a
pendulum in the previous section.  However, sometimes it is more
instructive to look at other types of visualizations. For example, we
have the pendulum and the free body diagram in Figures
:ref:`vib:app:pendulum:fig_problem` and
:ref:`vib:app:pendulum:fig_forces`. We may think of these figures as
animations in time instead. Especially the free body diagram will show both the
motion of the pendulum *and* the size of the forces during the motion.
The present section exemplifies how to make such a dynamic body
diagram.

Dynamic physical sketches, coupled to the numerical solution of
differential equations, requires a program to produce a sketch for
the situation at each time level.
`Pysketcher <https://github.com/hplgit/pysketcher>`__ is such a tool.
In fact (and not surprising!) Figures :ref:`vib:app:pendulum:fig_problem` and
:ref:`vib:app:pendulum:fig_forces` were drawn using Pysketcher.
The details of the drawings are explained in the
`Pysketcher tutorial <http://hplgit.github.io/pysketcher/doc/web/index.html>`__.
Here, we outline how this type of sketch can be used to create an animated
free body diagram during the motion of a pendulum.

Pysketcher is actually a layer of useful abstractions on top of
standard plotting packages. This means that we in fact apply Matplotlib
to make the animated free body diagram, but instead of dealing with a wealth
of detailed Matplotlib commands, we can express the drawing in terms of
more high-level objects, e.g., objects for the wire, angle :math:`\theta`,
body with mass :math:`m`, arrows for forces, etc. When the position of these
objects are given through variables, we can just couple those variables
to the dynamic solution of our ODE and thereby make a unique drawing
for each :math:`\theta` value in a simulation.

Writing the solver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let us start with the most familiar part of the current problem:
writing the solver function. We use Odespy for this purpose.
We also work with dimensionless equations. Since :math:`\theta` can be
viewed as dimensionless, we only need to introduce a dimensionless time,
here taken as :math:`\bar t = t/\sqrt{L/g}`.
The resulting dimensionless mathematical model for :math:`\theta`,
the dimensionless angular velocity :math:`\omega`, the
dimensionless wire force :math:`\bar S`, and the dimensionless
drag force :math:`\bar D` is then

.. _Eq:vib:app:pendulum_bodydia:eqth:

.. math::

    \tag{128}
    \frac{d\omega}{d\bar t} = - \alpha|\omega|\omega - \sin\theta,
        
        

.. _Eq:vib:app:pendulum_bodydia:eqomega:

.. math::

    \tag{129}
    \frac{d\theta}{d\bar t} = \omega,
        
        

.. _Eq:vib:app:pendulum_bodydia:eqS:

.. math::

    \tag{130}
    \bar S = \omega^2 + \cos\theta,
        
        

.. _Eq:vib:app:pendulum_bodydia:eqD:

.. math::

    \tag{131}
    \bar D = -\alpha |\omega|\omega,
        
        

with

.. math::
         \alpha = \frac{C_D\varrho\pi R^2L}{2m}{\thinspace .}

as a dimensionless parameter expressing the ratio of the drag force and
the gravity force. The dimensionless :math:`\omega` is made non-dimensional
by the time, so :math:`\omega\sqrt{L/g}` is the corresponding angular
frequency with dimensions.

.. :ref:`vib:exer:pendulum_simple` asks you to carry out the details of

.. the scaling.

A suitable function for computing
:ref:`(128) <Eq:vib:app:pendulum_bodydia:eqth>`-:ref:`(131) <Eq:vib:app:pendulum_bodydia:eqD>`
is listed below.

.. code-block:: python

    def simulate(alpha, Theta, dt, T):
        import odespy
    
        def f(u, t, alpha):
            omega, theta = u
            return [-alpha*omega*abs(omega) - sin(theta),
                    omega]
    
        import numpy as np
        Nt = int(round(T/float(dt)))
        t = np.linspace(0, Nt*dt, Nt+1)
        solver = odespy.RK4(f, f_args=[alpha])
        solver.set_initial_condition([0, Theta])
        u, t = solver.solve(
            t, terminate=lambda u, t, n: abs(u[n,1]) < 1E-3)
        omega = u[:,0]
        theta = u[:,1]
        S = omega**2 + np.cos(theta)
        drag = -alpha*np.abs(omega)*omega
        return t, theta, omega, S, drag

Drawing the free body diagram
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``sketch`` function below applies Pysketcher objects to build
a diagram like that in Figure :ref:`vib:app:pendulum:fig_forces`,
except that we have removed the rotation point :math:`(x_0,y_0)` and
the unit vectors in polar coordinates as these objects are not
important for an animated free body diagram.

Making the animated free body diagram
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It now remains to couple the ``simulate`` and ``sketch`` functions.
We first run ``simulate``:

.. code-block:: python

    from math import pi, radians, degrees
    import numpy as np
    alpha = 0.4
    period = 2*pi   # Use small theta approximation
    T = 12*period   # Simulate for 12 periods
    dt = period/40  # 40 time steps per period
    a = 70          # Initial amplitude in degrees
    Theta = radians(a)
    
    t, theta, omega, S, drag = simulate(alpha, Theta, dt, T)

The next step is to run through the time levels in the simulation and
make a sketch at each level:

.. code-block:: python

    for time_level, t_ in enumerate(t):
        sketch(theta, S, mg, drag, t_, time_level)

The individual sketches are (by the ``sketch`` function) saved in files
with names ``tmp_%04d.png``. These can be combined to videos using
(e.g.) ``ffmpeg``. A complete function ``animate`` for running the
simulation and creating video files is
listed below.

.. code-block:: python

    def animate():
        # Clean up old plot files
        import os, glob
        for filename in glob.glob('tmp_*.png') + glob.glob('movie.*'):
            os.remove(filename)
        # Solve problem
        from math import pi, radians, degrees
        import numpy as np
        alpha = 0.4
        period = 2*pi   # Use small theta approximation
        T = 12*period   # Simulate for 12 periods
        dt = period/40  # 40 time steps per period
        a = 70          # Initial amplitude in degrees
        Theta = radians(a)
    
        t, theta, omega, S, drag = simulate(alpha, Theta, dt, T)
    
        # Visualize drag force 5 times as large
        drag *= 5
        mg = np.ones(S.size)  # Gravity force (needed in sketch)
    
        # Draw animation
        import time
        for time_level, t_ in enumerate(t):
            sketch(theta, S, mg, drag, t_, time_level)
            time.sleep(0.2)  # Pause between each frame on the screen
    
        # Make videos
        prog = 'ffmpeg'
        filename = 'tmp_%04d.png'
        fps = 6
        codecs = {'flv': 'flv', 'mp4': 'libx264',
                  'webm': 'libvpx', 'ogg': 'libtheora'}
        for ext in codecs:
            lib = codecs[ext]
            cmd = '%(prog)s -i %(filename)s -r %(fps)s ' % vars()
            cmd += '-vcodec %(lib)s movie.%(ext)s' % vars()
            print(cmd)

Consider a pendulum as in Figure :ref:`vib:app:pendulum:fig_problem`, but
this time the wire is elastic. The length of the wire when it is not
stretched is :math:`L_0`, while :math:`L(t)` is the stretched
length at time :math:`t` during the motion.

Stretching the elastic wire a distance :math:`\Delta L` gives rise to a
spring force :math:`k\Delta L` in the opposite direction of the
stretching. Let :math:`\boldsymbol{n}` be a unit normal vector along the wire
from the point :math:`\boldsymbol{r}_0=(x_0,y_0)` and in the direction of :math:`\boldsymbol{i}_{\theta}`, see
Figure :ref:`vib:app:pendulum:fig_forces` for definition of :math:`(x_0,y_0)`
and :math:`\boldsymbol{i}_{\theta}`. Obviously, we have :math:`\boldsymbol{n}=\boldsymbol{i}_{\theta}`, but in this modeling
of an elastic pendulum we do not need polar coordinates.  Instead, it
is more straightforward to develop the equation in Cartesian
coordinates.

A mathematical expression for :math:`\boldsymbol{n}` is

.. math::
         \boldsymbol{n} = \frac{\boldsymbol{r}-\boldsymbol{r}_0}{L(t)},

where :math:`L(t)=||\boldsymbol{r}-\boldsymbol{r}_0||` is the current length of the elastic wire.
The position vector :math:`\boldsymbol{r}` in Cartesian coordinates reads
:math:`\boldsymbol{r}(t) = x(t)\boldsymbol{i} + y(t)\boldsymbol{j}`, where :math:`\boldsymbol{i}` and :math:`\boldsymbol{j}` are unit vectors
in the :math:`x` and :math:`y` directions, respectively.
It is convenient to introduce the Cartesian components :math:`n_x` and :math:`n_y`
of the normal vector:

.. math::
         \boldsymbol{n} = \frac{\boldsymbol{r}-\boldsymbol{r}_0}{L(t)} = \frac{x(t)-x_0}{L(t)}\boldsymbol{i} + \frac{y(t)-y_0}{L(t)}\boldsymbol{j} = n_x\boldsymbol{i} + n_y\boldsymbol{j}{\thinspace .}

The stretch :math:`\Delta L` in the wire is

.. math::
         \Delta t = L(t) - L_0{\thinspace .}

The force in the wire is then :math:`-S\boldsymbol{n}=-k\Delta L\boldsymbol{n}`.

The other forces are the gravity and the air resistance, just as in
Figure :ref:`vib:app:pendulum:fig_forces`. For motion in air we can
neglect the added mass and buoyancy effects.  The main difference is
that we have a *model* for :math:`S` in terms of the motion (as soon as we
have expressed :math:`\Delta L` by :math:`\boldsymbol{r}`). For simplicity, we drop the air
resistance term (but :ref:`vib:exer:pendulum_elastic_drag` asks
you to include it).

Newton's second law of motion applied to the body now results in

.. _Eq:vib:app:pendulum_elastic:eq1:

.. math::

    \tag{132}
    m\ddot\boldsymbol{r} = -k(L-L_0)\boldsymbol{n} - mg\boldsymbol{j}
        
        

The two components of
:ref:`(132) <Eq:vib:app:pendulum_elastic:eq1>` are

.. _Eq:_auto50:

.. math::

    \tag{133}
    \ddot x = -\frac{k}{m}(L-L_0)n_x,
        
        

.. _Eq:vib:app:pendulum_elastic:eq2a:

    \tag{134}
    .. _Eq:vib:app:pendulum_elastic:eq2b:

.. math::

    \tag{135}
    \ddot y = - \frac{k}{m}(L-L_0)n_y - g
        {\thinspace .}
        

Remarks about an elastic vs a non-elastic pendulum
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that the derivation of the ODEs for an elastic pendulum is more
straightforward than for a classical, non-elastic pendulum,
since we avoid the details
with polar coordinates, but instead work with Newton's second law
directly in Cartesian coordinates. The reason why we can do this is that
the elastic pendulum undergoes a general two-dimensional motion where
all the forces are known or expressed as functions of :math:`x(t)` and :math:`y(t)`,
such that we get two ordinary differential equations.
The motion of the non-elastic pendulum, on the other hand, is constrained:
the body has to move along a circular path, and the force :math:`S` in the
wire is unknown.

The non-elastic pendulum therefore leads to
a *differential-algebraic* equation, i.e., ODEs for :math:`x(t)` and :math:`y(t)`
combined with an extra constraint :math:`(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2 = L^2`
ensuring that the motion takes place along a circular path.
The extra constraint (equation) is compensated by an extra unknown force
:math:`-S\boldsymbol{n}`. Differential-algebraic equations are normally hard
to solve, especially with pen and paper.
Fortunately, for the non-elastic pendulum we can do a
trick: in polar coordinates the unknown force :math:`S` appears only in the
radial component of Newton's second law, while the unknown
degree of freedom for describing the motion, the angle :math:`\theta(t)`,
is completely governed by the asimuthal component. This allows us to
decouple the unknowns :math:`S` and :math:`\theta`. But this is a kind of trick and
not a widely applicable method. With an elastic pendulum we use straightforward
reasoning with Newton's 2nd law and arrive at a standard ODE problem that
(after scaling) is easy solve on a computer.

Initial conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What is the initial position of the body? We imagine that first the
pendulum hangs in equilibrium in its vertical position, and then it is
displaced an angle :math:`\Theta`. The equilibrium position is governed
by the ODEs with the accelerations set to zero.
The :math:`x` component leads to :math:`x(t)=x_0`, while the :math:`y` component gives

.. math::
         0 = - \frac{k}{m}(L-L_0)n_y - g = \frac{k}{m}(L(0)-L_0) - g\quad\Rightarrow\quad
        L(0) = L_0 + mg/k,

since :math:`n_y=-11` in this position. The corresponding :math:`y` value is then
from :math:`n_y=-1`:

.. math::
         y(t) = y_0 - L(0) = y_0 - (L_0 + mg/k){\thinspace .}

Let us now choose :math:`(x_0,y_0)` such that the body is at the origin
in the equilibrium position:

.. math::
         x_0 =0,\quad y_0 = L_0 + mg/k{\thinspace .}

Displacing the body an angle :math:`\Theta` to the right leads to the
initial position

.. math::
         x(0)=(L_0+mg/k)\sin\Theta,\quad y(0)=(L_0+mg/k)(1-\cos\Theta){\thinspace .}

The initial velocities can be set to zero: :math:`x'(0)=y'(0)=0`.

The complete ODE problem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can summarize all the equations as follows:

.. math::
        
        \ddot x &= -\frac{k}{m}(L-L_0)n_x,
        \\ 
        \ddot y &= -\frac{k}{m}(L-L_0)n_y - g,
        \\ 
        L &= \sqrt{(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2},
        \\ 
        n_x &= \frac{x-x_0}{L},
        \\ 
        n_y &= \frac{y-y_0}{L},
        \\ 
        x(0) &= (L_0+mg/k)\sin\Theta,
        \\ 
        x'(0) &= 0,
        \\ 
        y(0) & =(L_0+mg/k)(1-\cos\Theta),
        \\ 
        y'(0) &= 0{\thinspace .}
        

We insert :math:`n_x` and :math:`n_y`  in the ODEs:

.. _Eq:vib:app:pendulum_elastic:x:

.. math::

    \tag{136}
    \ddot x = -\frac{k}{m}\left(1 -\frac{L_0}{L}\right)(x-x_0),
        
        

.. _Eq:vib:app:pendulum_elastic:y:

.. math::

    \tag{137}
    \ddot y = -\frac{k}{m}\left(1 -\frac{L_0}{L}\right)(y-y_0) - g,
        
        

.. _Eq:vib:app:pendulum_elastic:L:

.. math::

    \tag{138}
    L = \sqrt{(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2},
        
        

.. _Eq:vib:app:pendulum_elastic:x0:

.. math::

    \tag{139}
    x(0) = (L_0+mg/k)\sin\Theta,
        
        

.. _Eq:vib:app:pendulum_elastic:vx0:

.. math::

    \tag{140}
    x'(0) = 0,
        
        

.. _Eq:vib:app:pendulum_elastic:y0:

.. math::

    \tag{141}
    y(0)  =(L_0+mg/k)(1-\cos\Theta),
        
        

.. _Eq:vib:app:pendulum_elastic:vy0:

.. math::

    \tag{142}
    y'(0) = 0{\thinspace .}
        
        

Scaling          (3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index:: round-off error

.. index:: scaling

The elastic pendulum model can be used to study both an elastic pendulum
and a classic, non-elastic pendulum. The latter problem is obtained
by letting :math:`k\rightarrow\infty`. Unfortunately,
a serious problem with the ODEs
:ref:`(136) <Eq:vib:app:pendulum_elastic:x>`-:ref:`(137) <Eq:vib:app:pendulum_elastic:y>` is that for large :math:`k`, we have a very large factor :math:`k/m` multiplied by a
very small number :math:`1-L_0/L`, since for large :math:`k`, :math:`L\approx L_0` (very
small deformations of the wire). The product is subject to
significant round-off errors for many relevant physical values of
the parameters. To circumvent the problem, we introduce a scaling. This
will also remove physical parameters from the problem such that we end
up with only one dimensionless parameter,
closely related to the elasticity of the wire. Simulations can then be
done by setting just this dimensionless parameter.

The characteristic length can be taken such that in equilibrium, the
scaled length is unity, i.e., the characteristic length is :math:`L_0+mg/k`:

.. math::
         \bar x = \frac{x}{L_0+mg/k},\quad \bar y = \frac{y}{L_0+mg/k}{\thinspace .}

We must then also work with the scaled length :math:`\bar L = L/(L_0+mg/k)`.

Introducing :math:`\bar t=t/t_c`, where :math:`t_c` is a characteristic time we
have to decide upon later, one gets

.. math::
        
        \frac{d^2\bar x}{d\bar t^2} &=
        -t_c^2\frac{k}{m}\left(1 -\frac{L_0}{L_0+mg/k}\frac{1}{\bar L}\right)\bar x,\\ 
        \frac{d^2\bar y}{d\bar t^2} &=
        -t_c^2\frac{k}{m}\left(1 -\frac{L_0}{L_0+mg/k}\frac{1}{\bar L}\right)(\bar y-1)
        -t_c^2\frac{g}{L_0 + mg/k},\\ 
        \bar L &= \sqrt{\bar x^2 + (\bar y-1)^2},\\ 
        \bar x(0) &= \sin\Theta,\\ 
        \bar x'(0) &= 0,\\ 
        \bar y(0) & = 1 - \cos\Theta,\\ 
        \bar y'(0) &= 0{\thinspace .}
        

For a non-elastic pendulum with small angles, we know that the
frequency of the oscillations are :math:`\omega = \sqrt{L/g}`. It is therefore
natural to choose a similar expression here, either the length in
the equilibrium position,

.. math::
         t_c^2 = \frac{L_0+mg/k}{g}{\thinspace .}

or simply the unstretched length,

.. math::
         t_c^2 = \frac{L_0}{g}{\thinspace .}

These quantities are not very different (since the elastic model
is valid only for quite small elongations), so we take the latter as it is
the simplest one.

The ODEs become

.. math::
        
        \frac{d^2\bar x}{d\bar t^2} &=
        -\frac{L_0k}{mg}\left(1 -\frac{L_0}{L_0+mg/k}\frac{1}{\bar L}\right)\bar x,\\ 
        \frac{d^2\bar y}{d\bar t^2} &=
        -\frac{L_0k}{mg}\left(1 -\frac{L_0}{L_0+mg/k}\frac{1}{\bar L}\right)(\bar y-1)
        -\frac{L_0}{L_0 + mg/k},\\ 
        \bar L &= \sqrt{\bar x^2 + (\bar y-1)^2}{\thinspace .}
        

We can now identify a dimensionless number

.. math::
         \beta = \frac{L_0}{L_0 + mg/k} = \frac{1}{1+\frac{mg}{L_0k}},

which is the ratio of the unstretched length and the
stretched length in equilibrium. The non-elastic pendulum will have
:math:`\beta =1` (:math:`k\rightarrow\infty`).
With :math:`\beta` the ODEs read

.. _Eq:vib:app:pendulum_elastic:x:s:

.. math::

    \tag{143}
    \frac{d^2\bar x}{d\bar t^2} =
        -\frac{\beta}{1-\beta}\left(1- \frac{\beta}{\bar L}\right)\bar x,
        
        

.. _Eq:vib:app:pendulum_elastic:y:s:

.. math::

    \tag{144}
    \frac{d^2\bar y}{d\bar t^2} =
        -\frac{\beta}{1-\beta}\left(1- \frac{\beta}{\bar L}\right)(\bar y-1)
        -\beta,
        
        

.. _Eq:vib:app:pendulum_elastic:L:s:

.. math::

    \tag{145}
    \bar L = \sqrt{\bar x^2 + (\bar y-1)^2},
        
        

.. _Eq:vib:app:pendulum_elastic:x0:s:

.. math::

    \tag{146}
    \bar x(0) = (1+\epsilon)\sin\Theta,
        
        

.. _Eq:vib:app:pendulum_elastic:vx0:s:

.. math::

    \tag{147}
    \frac{d\bar x}{d\bar t}(0) = 0,
        
        

.. _Eq:vib:app:pendulum_elastic:y0:s:

.. math::

    \tag{148}
    \bar y(0) = 1 - (1+\epsilon)\cos\Theta,
        
        

.. _Eq:vib:app:pendulum_elastic:vy0:s:

.. math::

    \tag{149}
    \frac{d\bar y}{d\bar t}(0) = 0,
        
        

We have here added a parameter :math:`\epsilon`, which is an additional
downward stretch of the wire at :math:`t=0`. This parameter makes it possible
to do a desired test: vertical oscillations of the pendulum. Without
:math:`\epsilon`, starting the motion from :math:`(0,0)` with zero velocity will
result in :math:`x=y=0` for all times (also a good test!), but with
an initial stretch so the body's position is :math:`(0,\epsilon)`, we
will have oscillatory vertical motion with amplitude :math:`\epsilon` (see
:ref:`vib:exer:pendulum_elastic`).

Remark on the non-elastic limit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We immediately see that as :math:`k\rightarrow\infty` (i.e., we obtain a non-elastic
pendulum), :math:`\beta\rightarrow 1`, :math:`\bar L\rightarrow 1`, and we have
very small values :math:`1-\beta\bar L^{-1}` divided by very small values
:math:`1-\beta` in the ODEs. However, it turns out that we can set :math:`\beta`
very close to one and obtain a path of the body that within the visual
accuracy of a plot does not show any elastic oscillations.
(Should the division of very small values become a problem, one can
study the limit by L'Hospital's rule:

.. math::
         \lim_{\beta\rightarrow 1}\frac{1 - \beta \bar L^{-1}}{1-\beta}
        = \frac{1}{\bar L},

and use the limit :math:`\bar L^{-1}` in the ODEs for :math:`\beta` values very
close to 1.)

Vehicle on a bumpy road
-----------------------

.. _vib:app:bumpy:fig:sketch:

.. figure:: bumpy_sketch.png
   :width: 400

   *Sketch of one-wheel vehicle on a bumpy road*

We consider a very simplistic vehicle, on one wheel, rolling along a
bumpy road. The oscillatory nature of the road will induce an external
forcing on the spring system in the vehicle and cause vibrations.
Figure :ref:`vib:app:bumpy:fig:sketch` outlines the situation.

To derive the equation that governs the motion, we must first establish
the position vector of the black mass at the top of the spring.
Suppose the spring has length :math:`L` without any elongation or compression,
suppose the radius of the wheel is :math:`R`, and suppose the height of the
black mass at the top is :math:`H`. With the aid of the :math:`\boldsymbol{r}_0` vector
in Figure :ref:`vib:app:bumpy:fig:sketch`, the position :math:`\boldsymbol{r}` of
the center point of the mass is

.. _Eq:_auto51:

.. math::

    \tag{150}
    \boldsymbol{r} = \boldsymbol{r}_0 + 2R\boldsymbol{j} + L\boldsymbol{j} + u\boldsymbol{j} + \frac{1}{2} H\boldsymbol{j},\ 
        
        

where :math:`u` is the elongation or compression in the spring according to
the (unknown and to be computed) vertical displacement :math:`u` relative to the
road. If the vehicle travels
with constant horizontal velocity :math:`v` and :math:`h(x)` is the shape of the
road, then the vector :math:`\boldsymbol{r}_0` is

.. math::
         \boldsymbol{r}_0 = vt\boldsymbol{i} + h(vt)\boldsymbol{j},

if the motion starts from :math:`x=0` at time :math:`t=0`.

The forces on the mass is the gravity, the spring force, and an optional
damping force that is proportional to the vertical velocity :math:`\dot u`. Newton's
second law of motion then tells that

.. math::
         m\ddot\boldsymbol{r} = -mg\boldsymbol{j} - s(u) - b\dot u\boldsymbol{j}{\thinspace .}

This leads to

.. math::
        
        m\ddot u = - s(u) - b\dot u - mg -mh''(vt)v^2
        

To simplify a little bit, we omit the gravity force :math:`mg` in comparison with
the other terms. Introducing :math:`u'` for :math:`\dot u` then gives a standard
damped, vibration equation with external forcing:

.. _Eq:_auto52:

.. math::

    \tag{151}
    mu'' + bu' + s(u) =  -mh''(vt)v^2{\thinspace .}
        
        

Since the road is normally known just as a set of array values, :math:`h''` must
be computed by finite differences. Let :math:`\Delta x` be the spacing between
measured values :math:`h_i= h(i\Delta x)` on the road. The discrete second-order
derivative :math:`h''` reads

.. math::
         q_i = \frac{h_{i-1} - 2h_i + h_{i+1}}{\Delta x^2}, \quad i=1,\ldots,N_x-1{\thinspace .}

We may for maximum simplicity set
the end points as :math:`q_0=q_1` and :math:`q_{N_x}=q_{N_x-1}`.
The term :math:`-mh''(vt)v^2` corresponds to a force with discrete time values

.. math::
         F^n = -mq_n v^2,\quad \Delta t = v^{-1}\Delta x{\thinspace .}

This force can be directly used in a numerical model

.. math::
         [mD_tD_t u + bD_{2t} u + s(u) = F]^n{\thinspace .}

Software for computing :math:`u` and also making an animated sketch of
the motion like we did in the section :ref:`vib:app:pendulum_bodydia`
is found in a separate project on the web:
`<https://github.com/hplgit/bumpy>`_. You may start looking at the
`tutorial <http://hplgit.github.io/bumpy/doc/pub/bumpy.html>`__.

.. _vib:app:bouncing_ball:

Bouncing ball
-------------

A bouncing ball is a ball in free vertically fall until it impacts the
ground, but during the impact, some kinetic energy is lost, and a new
motion upwards with reduced velocity starts. After the motion is retarded,
a new free fall starts, and the process is repeated. At some point the
velocity close to the ground is so small that the ball is considered
to be finally at rest.

The motion of the ball falling in air is governed by Newton's second
law :math:`F=ma`, where :math:`a` is the acceleration of the body, :math:`m` is the mass,
and :math:`F` is the sum of all forces. Here, we neglect the air resistance
so that gravity :math:`-mg` is the only force. The height of the ball is
denoted by :math:`h` and :math:`v` is the velocity. The relations between :math:`h`, :math:`v`, and
:math:`a`,

.. math::
         h'(t)= v(t),\quad v'(t) = a(t),

combined with Newton's second law gives the ODE model

.. _Eq:vib:app:bouncing:ball:h2eq:

.. math::

    \tag{152}
    h^{\prime\prime}(t) = -g,
        
        

or expressed alternatively as a system of first-order equations:

.. _Eq:vib:app:bouncing:ball:veq:

.. math::

    \tag{153}
    v'(t) = -g,
         
        

.. _Eq:vib:app:bouncing:ball:heq:

.. math::

    \tag{154}
    h'(t) = v(t){\thinspace .}
        
        

These equations govern the motion as long as the ball is away from
the ground by a small distance :math:`\epsilon_h > 0`. When :math:`h<\epsilon_h`,
we have two cases.

1. The ball impacts the ground, recognized by a sufficiently large negative
   velocity (:math:`v<-\epsilon_v`). The velocity then changes sign and is
   reduced by a factor :math:`C_R`, known as the `coefficient of restitution <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_restitution>`__.
   For plotting purposes, one may set :math:`h=0`.

2. The motion stops, recognized by a sufficiently small velocity
   (:math:`|v|<\epsilon_v`) close to the ground.

.. _vib:app:gravitation:

Two-body gravitational problem
------------------------------

Consider two astronomical objects :math:`A` and :math:`B` that attract each other
by gravitational forces. :math:`A` and :math:`B` could be two stars in a binary
system, a planet orbiting a star, or a moon orbiting a planet.
Each object is acted upon by the
gravitational force due to the other object. Consider motion in a plane
(for simplicity) and let :math:`(x_A,y_A)` and :math:`(x_B,y_B)` be the
positions of object :math:`A` and :math:`B`, respectively.

The governing equations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Newton's second law of motion applied to each object is all we need
to set up a mathematical model for this physical problem:

.. _Eq:_auto53:

.. math::

    \tag{155}
    m_A\ddot\boldsymbol{x}_A = \boldsymbol{F},
        
        

.. _Eq:_auto54:

.. math::

    \tag{156}
    m_B\ddot\boldsymbol{x}_B = -\boldsymbol{F},
        
        

where :math:`F` is the gravitational force

.. math::
         \boldsymbol{F} = \frac{Gm_Am_B}{||\boldsymbol{r}||^3}\boldsymbol{r},

where

.. math::
         \boldsymbol{r}(t) = \boldsymbol{x}_B(t) - \boldsymbol{x}_A(t),

and :math:`G` is the gravitational constant:
:math:`G=6.674\cdot 10^{-11}\hbox{ Nm}^2/\hbox{kg}^2`.

Scaling          (4)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A problem with these equations is that the parameters are very large
(:math:`m_A`, :math:`m_B`, :math:`||\boldsymbol{r}||`) or very small (:math:`G`). The rotation time
for binary stars can be very small and large as well. It is therefore
advantageous to scale the equations.
A natural length scale could be the initial distance between the objects:
:math:`L=\boldsymbol{r}(0)`. We write the dimensionless quantities as

.. math::
         \bar\boldsymbol{x}_A = \frac{\boldsymbol{x}_A}{L},\quad\bar\boldsymbol{x}_B = \frac{\boldsymbol{x}_B}{L},\quad
        \bar t = \frac{t}{t_c}{\thinspace .}

The gravity force is transformed to

.. math::
         \boldsymbol{F} = \frac{Gm_Am_B}{L^2||\bar\boldsymbol{r}||^3}\bar\boldsymbol{r},\quad \bar\boldsymbol{r} = \bar\boldsymbol{x}_B - \bar\boldsymbol{x}_A,

so the first ODE for :math:`\boldsymbol{x}_A` becomes

.. math::
         \frac{d^2 \bar\boldsymbol{x}_A}{d\bar t^2} =
        \frac{Gm_Bt_c^2}{L^3}\frac{\bar\boldsymbol{r}}{||\bar\boldsymbol{r}||^3}{\thinspace .}

Assuming that quantities with a bar and their derivatives are around unity
in size, it is natural to choose :math:`t_c` such that the fraction :math:`Gm_Bt_c/L^2=1`:

.. math::
         t_c = \sqrt{\frac{L^3}{Gm_B}}{\thinspace .}

From the other equation for :math:`\boldsymbol{x}_B` we get another candidate for :math:`t_c` with
:math:`m_A` instead of :math:`m_B`. Which mass we choose play a role if :math:`m_A\ll m_B` or
:math:`m_B\ll m_A`. One solution is to use the sum of the masses:

.. math::
         t_c = \sqrt{\frac{L^3}{G(m_A+m_B)}}{\thinspace .}

Taking a look at `Kepler's laws <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion>`__ of planetary motion, the orbital period for a planet around the star is given by the :math:`t_c` above, except for a missing factor of :math:`2\pi`,
but that means that :math:`t_c^{-1}` is just the angular frequency of the motion.
Our characteristic time :math:`t_c` is therefore highly relevant.
Introducing the dimensionless number

.. math::
         \alpha = \frac{m_A}{m_B},

we can write the dimensionless ODE as

.. _Eq:_auto55:

.. math::

    \tag{157}
    \frac{d^2 \bar\boldsymbol{x}_A}{d\bar t^2} =
        \frac{1}{1+\alpha}\frac{\bar\boldsymbol{r}}{||\bar\boldsymbol{r}||^3},
        
        

.. _Eq:_auto56:

.. math::

    \tag{158}
    \frac{d^2 \bar\boldsymbol{x}_B}{d\bar t^2} =
        \frac{1}{1+\alpha^{-1}}\frac{\bar\boldsymbol{r}}{||\bar\boldsymbol{r}||^3}{\thinspace .}
        
        

In the limit :math:`m_A\ll m_B`, i.e., :math:`\alpha\ll 1`,
object B stands still, say :math:`\bar\boldsymbol{x}_B=0`, and object
A orbits according to

.. math::
         \frac{d^2 \bar\boldsymbol{x}_A}{d\bar t^2} = -\frac{\bar\boldsymbol{x}_A}{||\bar \boldsymbol{x}_A||^3}{\thinspace .}

Solution in a special case: planet orbiting a star
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To better see the motion, and that our scaling is reasonable,
we introduce polar coordinates :math:`r` and :math:`\theta`:

.. math::
         \bar\boldsymbol{x}_A = r\cos\theta\boldsymbol{i} + r\sin\theta\boldsymbol{j},

which means :math:`\bar\boldsymbol{x}_A` can be written as :math:`\bar\boldsymbol{x}_A =r{\boldsymbol{i}_r}`. Since

.. math::
         \frac{d}{dt}{\boldsymbol{i}_r} = \dot\theta\boldsymbol{i}_{\theta},\quad \frac{d}{dt}\boldsymbol{i}_{\theta} = -\dot\theta{\boldsymbol{i}_r},

we have

.. math::
         \frac{d^2 \bar\boldsymbol{x}_A}{d\bar t^2} =
        (\ddot r - r\dot\theta^2){\boldsymbol{i}_r} + (r\ddot\theta + 2\dot r\dot\theta)\boldsymbol{i}_{\theta}{\thinspace .}
        

The equation of motion for mass A is then

.. math::
        
        \ddot r - r\dot\theta^2 &= -\frac{1}{r^2},\\ 
        r\ddot\theta + 2\dot r\dot\theta &= 0{\thinspace .}
        

The special case of circular motion, :math:`r=1`, fulfills the equations, since
the latter equation then gives :math:`\dot\theta =\hbox{const}` and
the former then gives :math:`\dot\theta = 1`, i.e., the motion is
:math:`r(t)=1`, :math:`\theta(t)=t`, with unit angular frequency as expected and
period :math:`2\pi` as expected.

Electric circuits
-----------------

Although the term "mechanical vibrations" is used in the present
book, we must mention that the same type of equations arise
when modeling electric circuits.
The current :math:`I(t)` in a
circuit with an inductor with inductance :math:`L`, a capacitor with
capacitance :math:`C`, and overall resistance :math:`R`, is governed by

.. _Eq:_auto57:

.. math::

    \tag{159}
    \ddot I + \frac{R}{L}\dot I + \frac{1}{LC}I = \dot V(t),
        
        

where :math:`V(t)` is the voltage source powering the circuit.
This equation has the same form as the general model considered in
the section :ref:`vib:model2` if we set :math:`u=I`, :math:`f(u^{\prime})=bu^{\prime}`
and define :math:`b=R/L`, :math:`s(u) = L^{-1}C^{-1}u`, and :math:`F(t)=\dot V(t)`.

Exercise 22: Simulate resonance
-------------------------------

.. index:: resonance

We consider the scaled ODE model
:ref:`(122) <Eq:vib:app:mass_gen:scaled>` from the section :ref:`vib:app:mass_gen`.
After scaling, the amplitude of :math:`u` will have a size about unity
as time grows and the effect of the initial conditions die out due
to damping. However, as :math:`\gamma\rightarrow 1`, the amplitude of :math:`u`
increases, especially if :math:`\beta` is small. This effect is called
*resonance*. The purpose of this exercise is to explore resonance.

**Hint.**
A naive implementation may get stuck in repeated impacts for large time
step sizes. To avoid this situation, one can introduce a state
variable that holds the mode of the motion: free fall, impact, or rest.
Two consecutive impacts imply that the motion has stopped.

Simulation of simple pendulum can be carried out by using

.. _vib:exer:pendulum_elastic:

Exercise 26: Simulate an elastic pendulum
-----------------------------------------

The section :ref:`vib:app:pendulum_elastic` describes a model for an elastic
pendulum, resulting in a system of two ODEs. The purpose of this
exercise is to implement the scaled model, test the software, and
generalize the model.

**a)**
Write a function ``simulate``
that can simulate an elastic pendulum using the scaled model.
The function should have the following arguments:

.. code-block:: python

    def simulate(
        beta=0.9,                 # dimensionless parameter
        Theta=30,                 # initial angle in degrees
        epsilon=0,                # initial stretch of wire
        num_periods=6,            # simulate for num_periods
        time_steps_per_period=60, # time step resolution
        plot=True,                # make plots or not
        ):

To set the total simulation time and the time step, we
use our knowledge of the scaled, classical, non-elastic pendulum:
:math:`u^{\prime\prime} + u = 0`, with solution
:math:`u = \Theta\cos \bar t`.
The period of these oscillations is :math:`P=2\pi`
and the frequency is unity. The time
for simulation is taken as ``num_periods`` times :math:`P`. The time step
is set as :math:`P` divided by ``time_steps_per_period``.

The ``simulate`` function should return the arrays of
:math:`x`, :math:`y`, :math:`\theta`, and :math:`t`, where :math:`\theta = \tan^{-1}(x/(1-y))` is
the angular displacement of the elastic pendulum corresponding to the
position :math:`(x,y)`.

If ``plot`` is ``True``, make a plot of :math:`\bar y(\bar t)`
versus :math:`\bar x(\bar t)`, i.e., the physical motion
of the mass at :math:`(\bar x,\bar y)`. Use the equal aspect ratio on the axis
such that we get a physically correct picture of the motion. Also
make a plot of :math:`\theta(\bar t)`, where :math:`\theta` is measured in degrees.
If :math:`\Theta < 10` degrees, add a plot that compares the solutions of
the scaled, classical, non-elastic pendulum and the elastic pendulum
(:math:`\theta(t)`).

Although the mathematics here employs a bar over scaled quantities, the
code should feature plain names ``x`` for :math:`\bar x`, ``y`` for :math:`\bar y`, and
``t`` for :math:`\bar t` (rather than ``x_bar``, etc.). These variable names make
the code easier to read and compare with the mathematics.

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint 1.**
Equal aspect ratio is set by ``plt.gca().set_aspect('equal')`` in
Matplotlib (``import matplotlib.pyplot as plt``)
and in SciTools by the command
``plt.plot(..., daspect=[1,1,1], daspectmode='equal')``
(provided you have done ``import scitools.std as plt``).

.. --- end hint in exercise ---

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint 2.**
If you want to use Odespy to solve the equations, order the ODEs
like :math:`\dot \bar x, \bar x, \dot\bar y,\bar y` such that
``odespy.EulerCromer`` can be applied.

.. --- end hint in exercise ---

.. removed !bsol ... !esol environment (because of the command-line option --without_solutions)

**b)**
Write a test function for testing that :math:`\Theta=0` and :math:`\epsilon=0`
gives :math:`x=y=0` for all times.

.. removed !bsol ... !esol environment (because of the command-line option --without_solutions)

**c)**
Write another test function for checking that the pure vertical
motion of the elastic pendulum is correct.
Start with simplifying the ODEs for pure vertical motion and show that
:math:`\bar y(\bar t)` fulfills a vibration equation with
frequency :math:`\sqrt{\beta/(1-\beta)}`. Set up the exact solution.

Write a test function that
uses this special case to verify the ``simulate`` function. There will
be numerical approximation errors present in the results from
``simulate`` so you have to believe in correct results and set a
(low) tolerance that corresponds to the computed maximum error.
Use a small :math:`\Delta t` to obtain a small numerical approximation error.

.. removed !bsol ... !esol environment (because of the command-line option --without_solutions)

**d)**
Make a function ``demo(beta, Theta)`` for simulating an elastic pendulum with a
given :math:`\beta` parameter and initial angle :math:`\Theta`. Use 600 time steps
per period to get every accurate results, and simulate for 3 periods.

.. _vib:exer:pendulum_elastic_drag:

Exercise 27: Simulate an elastic pendulum with air resistance
-------------------------------------------------------------

This is a continuation :ref:`vib:exer:pendulum_elastic`.
Air resistance on the body with mass :math:`m` can be modeled by the
force :math:`-\frac{1}{2}\varrho C_D A|\boldsymbol{v}|\boldsymbol{v}`,
where :math:`C_D` is a drag coefficient (0.2 for a sphere), :math:`\varrho`
is the density of air (1.2 :math:`\hbox{kg }\,{\hbox{m}}^{-3}`), :math:`A` is the
cross section area (:math:`A=\pi R^2` for a sphere, where :math:`R` is the radius),
and :math:`\boldsymbol{v}` is the velocity of the body.
Include air resistance in the original model, scale the model,
write a function ``simulate_drag`` that is a copy of the ``simulate``
function from :ref:`vib:exer:pendulum_elastic`, but with the
new ODEs included, and show plots of how air resistance
influences the motion.

.. Closing remarks for this Exercise

Remarks          (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Test functions are challenging to construct for the problem with
air resistance. You can reuse the tests from
:ref:`vib:exer:pendulum_elastic_drag` for ``simulate_drag``,
but these tests does not verify the new terms arising from air
resistance.

.. _vib:exer:gen:PEFRL:

Exercise 28: Implement the PEFRL algorithm
------------------------------------------

We consider the motion of a planet around a star (the section :ref:`vib:app:gravitation`).
The simplified case where one
mass is very much bigger than the other and one object is at rest,
results in the scaled ODE model

.. math::
        
        \ddot x + (x^2 + y^2)^{-3/2}x & = 0,\\ 
        \ddot y + (x^2 + y^2)^{-3/2}y & = 0{\thinspace .}
        

**a)**
It is easy to show that :math:`x(t)` and :math:`y(t)` go like sine and cosine
functions. Use this idea to derive the exact solution.

.. removed !bsol ... !esol environment (because of the command-line option --without_solutions)

**b)**
One believes that a planet may orbit a star for billions of years.
We are now interested
in how accurate methods we actually need for such calculations.
A first task is to determine what the time interval of interest is in
scaled units. Take the earth and sun as typical objects and find
the characteristic time used in the scaling of the equations
(:math:`t_c = \sqrt{L^3/(mG)}`), where :math:`m` is the mass of the sun, :math:`L` is the
distance between the sun and the earth, and :math:`G` is the gravitational
constant. Find the scaled time interval corresponding to one billion years.

.. removed !bsol ... !esol environment (because of the command-line option --without_solutions)

**c)**
Solve the equations using 4th-order Runge-Kutta and the Euler-Cromer
methods. You may benefit from applying Odespy for this purpose. With
each solver, simulate 10000 orbits and print the maximum position
error and CPU time as a function of time step. Note that the maximum
position error does not necessarily occur at the end of the
simulation. The position error achieved with each solver will depend
heavily on the size of the time step. Let the time step correspond to
200, 400, 800 and 1600 steps per orbit, respectively.  Are the results
as expected?  Explain briefly. When you develop your program, have in
mind that it will be extended with an implementation of the other
algorithms (as requested in d) and e) later) and experiments with this
algorithm as well.

.. removed !bsol ... !esol environment (because of the command-line option --without_solutions)

**d)**
Implement a solver based on the PEFRL method from
the section :ref:`vib:ode2:PEFRL`. Verify its 4th-order convergence
using an equation :math:`u'' + u = 0`.

.. removed !bsol ... !esol environment (because of the command-line option --without_solutions)

**e)**
The simulations done previously with the 4th-order Runge-Kutta and
Euler-Cromer are now to be repeated with the PEFRL solver, so the
code must be extended accordingly. Then run the simulations and comment
on the performance of PEFRL compared to the other two.

.. removed !bsol ... !esol environment (because of the command-line option --without_solutions)

**f)**
Use the PEFRL solver to simulate 100000 orbits with a fixed time step
corresponding to 1600 steps per period. Record the maximum error
within each subsequent group of 1000 orbits. Plot these errors and fit
(least squares) a mathematical function to the data. Print also the
total CPU time spent for all 100000 orbits.

Now, predict the error and required CPU time for a simulation of 1
billion years (orbits).  Is it feasible on today's computers to
simulate the planetary motion for one billion years?
